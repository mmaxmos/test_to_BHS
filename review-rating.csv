lutri;Maybe the best game I have ever played. It just, damn... THE GAME IS SO GOOD I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT!,,Well first to say I have never liked zombies and the idea of zombies was just so ridiculous to me BUT this game made me understand them more and why they exist.,,I really don't have more to say it is a solid 9 I would give it a 10 but the AI was sometimes so stupid and it noticed me even tho I didn't make a sound or anything...;normal;English;9

Svetlendrius;"A good shooter-horror adventure with the beloved story of ""father"" and ""daughter"".  A good arsenal of skills and weapons, in moments with the infected, the music perfectly keeps you in suspense.  I didn't like the spawn of mobs right on the ""ears"" when they sacrifice the tactical component for the sake of tension.  A little crooked dubbing in the transitional phrases of the characters.  Plus the American presentation of the already hackneyed storyline.";normal;English;8
Hodgeftm;This game has awoken my love for gaming, I went it to it not knowing any hype in regards to what I now know due to reading up when I completed it and the outrage it has caused amongst the Karen’s of the world.,The game is a masterpiece and the story is a thing a beauty and could have been used as a tv series it’s that gripping. Instantly up in there as one of my favourite all time games.;expanded;English;10

Cz3rw0ny;Amazing story and a pretty good gameplay, keeping in mind this game originally came out in 2013 for PS3.;expanded;English;9
Borz5;An awesome game. The flow of the story is nice. It always gives you a reason to continue the game. At the end we feel the characters close to us. The gameplay is also well detailed and fun. The AI is more than good. The enemies force you to step out from your comfort zone so usually you are the prey not the hunter. The game rewards the exploration. You should play this game.;expanded;English;10
Xplocion;"The good:,Great third person shooter game. Inventory management. Awesome graphics. Here the Let behind DLC is included. It has Multiplayer.,,The bad:,I did see The Road (Dimension Films, 2009) in the cinema, this game takes a lot of inspiration from that movie, not to say that it traces certain parts. Lots of motion blur that hides background errors but focuses the player's attention on the foreground and faces. After passing the impact of the graphics, after 30 minutes the game becomes repetitive and you have to constantly search for the bandages. Enemy AI is painful, enemies are bullet sponges. Ellie's AI is painful and in shootings she got stuck in walls or projections, the ""smart idea"" to justify this was: ""she's invisible to enemies"" (face-palm) when in Resident Evil 4 we see that Ashlie is just as useless in AI if she can be injured and the game is even over if she dies ...,,What Meh:,It is a game besides that it traces to the Movie The Road is good but not the masterpiece that everyone says. You ask many about parts that you liked about the game and the unanimous answer is the giraffe, because that is what the press showed them, after that little or nothing they know later and at least here is the Let Behind DLC where you can see it Ellie's preferences long before ""it became fashionable to be on the side of political correctness and gender diversity."" There are people who talk about this game as a masterpiece ... the game is good, so first buy the game and finish it and you will see that it is not a masterpiece at all, it is a good game nothing more.";normal;English;7
Cormacd69;Absolute perfection that you can revisit time and time again. What I would give to play this game for the very first time once more. A game has never left such an impact on me, from the relationship between Joel and Ellie to the beauty of the post apocalyptic world. What makes this game a masterpiece isn't the combat, or the gameplay mechanics, it's the fact that this game is a story, one that hooks you and doesn't let go. As the relationship forms between Joel and Ellie, your connection to both characters also grows, words can't do this game justice. If I was told I could recommend one game for every person to play once in their lives, this would be it.;normal;English;10
Pitipat;This game is suck it so hard and the zombie are have too much damage to hit me and when I shot them I have to use a lot ammo to kill them and sometime they kill me in one hit kill so don't buy this game;expanded;English;1

Messiah28;The way this game makes you feel is insane. Love the character building and the plot. As always, just another naughty dog game with amazing story and settings. Definitely recommend this game!;expanded;English;10
BenLea;The last of us is one of the best games I have ever played. In the beginning the game is seemingly just your average zombie story, with mediocre characters and good graphics. As the game develops, you begin to care for these characters, gaining a deeper understanding of their individual personalities, making you want to continute to play to see how they develop and see what happens to them. The game easily switches between a calming walk through a forest, and into an intense fight against a bunch of clickers. The way that the characters interact with each other is immaculate, and enhances the story, deepening your love for the characters.,,However, there are some bad things about the game, like sometimes a character won't know what to do and just stands there, or a character will get in your way while you're shooting, and also the fact that the other characters seem to be immune to sound and can sprint around whenever they want but other than that,,,This game is a masterpiece. 9/10;normal;English;9
swkane;What can I say about Last Of Us that hasn't been said many times before? I was a late, late comer to the series, but even this graphics snob popped this 7 year old remaster of an 8 year old game into his brand new PS5 and cried when the story ended. This story was the continuation of I am Legend that Middle School me never thought he would get. If you haven't played this game, just do yourself a favor and play it.;normal;English;10
Milemouse;In my opinion, this is undoubtedly and simply put the greatest game of all time;expanded;English;10
CRIBCURDZ;I’ve played a lot of awesome games since I got a PS4 in 2015. But this game really stands out as one the best games available on PS4 and one of my favourite games of all time. The brilliant character development and awesome mechanics and graphics really make this game incredible. The unique twist on the zombie outbreak story really makes it memorable. Fighting mechanics work really well with pretty good AI which provides a good challenge. One of my few complaints with the game is the lack of ammunition which becomes very apparent in very close situations when using a gun could save you, however this adds a big challenge to gunfights and more realism to the setting of the game. Overall however, this game is one of the best of all time and highly recommend it to anyone who is searching for a new, unique game which Is unlike any other zombie game out there. Especially with the release of the PS5 soon, now is the best time to play it before you leave your PS4 in the attic and forget about it.;normal;English;10
FnaLambies;this is a video game that has a more memorable story than game-play. I experienced this game shortly after i bought a ps4 it it is by far the best video game stories ever put in a game.;expanded;English;10
deathstramding;Naughty Dog and all the games she made, the whole series is amazing uncharted and last of us very great games my score is 10 to all;expanded;English;10
Capstivel;This is maybe one of the best games ever made. The story is so powerfull. The characters and thematics are superb. I can write an entire essay about the ending, just the ending. The graphics, the sad, alone environment, the music, just fits the game. The effort Naughty Dog put on the game can be witnessed. But, nothing is perfect, the gameplay can be boring, tedious and repetitive. In some parts, it literally obligates you to stay undercover, making it very boring and tedious.;normal;English;9
Glemial;When i started this game i was really expecting one of the best games of all time, because of all the praise this game gets. I am really disappointed.,The Story is ordinary, a world that has be taken by a fungus, and the citizens become zombies. Them we have a few that survived and now is fighting for their lives. We have so many game with similar story.,The characters has a good development, and this is the reason i give 4 to this game,The IA is so stupid that broke the immersion of the game. Seeing Elie walking in the front of a enemy and none of they reacting at all is ridiculous. If the game has stupid zombies it's fine, but people beeing so stupid as zombies really broke the game.,The Stealth is awful, as you throw a bottle near the enemy and has no reaction, but sometimes you throw and a guy from the otherside of the map comes to see what's happening, totally bad maded.,The combat is bad either, with really simplistic movements, and repetitive.,(SPOILER ALERT),The game ending is what i was hoping to be the savior of the game, but unfortunately wasn't.,Seeing joel rushing to a hospital full of fireflies, and killing all of then like he was Rambo, is laughable. The worse is that he alone kill practically a army and saves Ellie in the end of it. The story would be so more impacting if Ellie died to save the world. They could have shown it a few years later, the world rising up after healing came, showing Joel rising emotionally in a healed world. They could even make a new game showing this, but not, unfortunately.;normal;English;4

TagMeisteR;A brilliant and ground-breaking Game that set the standard for linear cinematic story-driven games.

The amazing detail in every step is simply breath taking!,,If you're interested. pick this game up and get tied into the ride of your life!

princey2001;the last of us is one of the greatest ever made its story, characters, game play, atmosphere is unlike any game ever made. the characters of Joel and Ellie start the next level of characters portrayed as real people the most of any game i have ever seen.

SCORE 98/100;normal;English;10
Rydberg98;Nice Game with a well written story. Despite having a few flaws the overall message and likability of the characters deserves a high rating. The Graphics are top notch. The levels are often tubular, so there is only one way to go. A more open design couldn't have hurt. The Gameplay is fun and I was not bored even after 20 hours. I would recommend also playing the DLC, because it adds a nice side story;normal;English;9
Ex-TLOU-Fan;Perfect game... Unfortunately spoiled with a disastrous sequel for political influence.;expanded;English;9
Isainepto;What makes this game a masterpiece is that its not based on a narrative focused on the impact of the journey, its based on the characters. You get to know them through dialogue and even through optional dialogue, and because of that when the story progresses, they evolve, and when they make choices, they are well argued in order to make sense to the great narrative this game has. The game-play is good enough for a game based on narrative, and it makes a good balance between both of them.;normal;English;10

psmoon21;This game is remembered above all for its story, but it is very poorly told, with poor phrases and predictable enough,,the game in its missions is repetitive, slow, rough and even graphically it is not the most incredible of ps3 or ps4.,,The remastered for ps4 is very poor, it still has graphics that are not bad but it is as top as they say,,It has some issues like stupid i.a, bugs, audio issues, and a b.s.o. very discreet.,,a game with those problems that are totally objective,It cannot be considered in any case a good game, much less goty or game of the generation.

PrinceNBD;The greatest Playstation game of all time, hands down. Game of the Year, Game of the Generation and Game of the Decade. These are a few of the countless honors it got. Obviously I can't list every accolade this game won because it would be a daunting task to mention 200 awards in a single review. That's right, this masterpiece of a game won over 200 awards and it deserved every last one of them. I can't sing any more praises about this game that already haven't been sung before.,If you own a PlayStation console (PS3/PS4/PS5) and you still haven't played this game, then I don't know what to say to you except, maybe you should think about selling your console. Because in a way, you're wasting your money by not utilizing your investment. This is literally the first game you should be playing after buying a PS console.,The Last of Us is the crown jewel of the gaming world. It is literally the best game ever made by Playstation and one of the greatest games of all time.;normal;English;10

NorwayGamer;Another garbage title from one of the worst devs out there: Naughty Dog.,,This developer apparently loves excessive violence, foul language and blasphemy. And for this I will throw my copy in the garbage instead of reselling it, as I don't want to contribute to anyone else playing this trash.,How good the gameplay and graphics are is completely irrelevant, when the game is all about foul language.;normal;English;1
Manziflex;The gameplay is truly innovative and is definitely the highlight of this game. Punching zombies is priceless. Beautiful story. The graphics, although remastered, are not exactly the best. The environment looks like just a bunch of polygons with some texture. you see the retouching but could have been done better;expanded;English;9
DiGol;"I passed the game two days ago. And 6 years later, she looks amazing.,No game, no movie, no TV series has ever caused me such emotions. The most I could do after watching my favorite TV series was to be a little sad.,After passing this game, I walked around all day with a strong sense of loss and despair, and at the end I began to cry. Tears just poured out of me in liters. And it because the game is so beautiful, I got so attached to the characters that I didn't want it to end, I couldn't believe it was over.,I passed it for 3 days.,After I played the first day I couldn't help but think about her, I wanted to go in and play again. I couldn't consume any content, like on Youtube, Instagram, or TikTok. It all seemed somehow empty. Between times when I played, I was accompanied by an incomprehensible feeling of despair.,It is very exciting to pass the game on stealth: sneak up and kill enemies with a knife, strangle them or kill them with a bow.,How could Naughty Dog make such a masterpiece in 2013? My mistake was that I passed the game at a medium level of difficulty, if you have not already passed it, then do it only at a high level or higher. Enjoy this masterpiece longer. I only played 15: 03: 49 hours.,Most of all, I liked playing for Ellie in the winter. Especially in the ""Left Behind"".,How I envy the people who haven't passed it yet.,It opened the life cycle of the PlayStation 4 and set the trend in games for the next years, and The Last of Us: Part 2 closed it.,Very emotional game with great gameplay.";normal;English;10

Dyn4mic;I left pc gaming in 2015 and hadn't owned a console since at least 2013. It was time to focus on work, family and just grow up. I'd wasted hundreds if not thousands of hours gaming and thought that was it for me. After reading lots of reviews and buckling to the hype I decided to get a PS4 just for The Last Of Us and have never regretted this decision.,The Last Of Us (TLOU) is more than a game, it would be fine to sit there and watch the entirety of the game as a cinematic. The story builds the characters, you learn to feel their pain, joy, and relied along the way. I didn't think a game would affect me so much, there are key scenes which really hit home hard. I've never experienced a game of this storytelling prowess and I almost hope not to again as I want to cherish this story. The music stuck in my head for days, weeks and even months. I wanted to learn the guitar just so I could reproduce the songs. Tell me what games have had this effect in you? I doubt many if any. The voice acting was solid and really helped suck you into the story, I think this was crucial to believing the story.,The gameplay worked for me and I really enjoyed the options of running and gunning or stealth.  The difficulty settings allow you to actually play through how you want, finishing it in normal before progressing to survivor was real fun.,I have always been a player who likes to emerse themselves psychologically into a game and have felt great connection to characters before, but TLOU was different. I didn't necessarily relate to Joel or Ellie but I did want them to succeed and to fight with them. I finished TLOU on survivor mode in 2019 and feel that survivor mode makes it feel less like a game and more real world. Do yourself a favour and finish TLOU as you will hopefully get to experience what I believe to be the most complete story any game to date has to offer.;normal;English;10

Is amazing, the characters are amazingly written, everything that happens is so human, and you can feel everything that the characters feels, The story is so simple, that it makes it so personal and so unique. The gameplay is very good considering it's not the most complex ever.,After playing this game 5 times, i can't think of a better game i've played, every time i play it, the ending got me almost crying, something that no movie, serie or anything to be honest did.;normal;English;10
keredd1010;"This film is a testament to how if you have really good writing in a game then other aspects of the game can slack, namely in this example, the game play. TLOU has an excellently fleshed out narrative with wonderful character development. There is no denying that. The game play is quite mediocre and I had to put it on hard setting the very first time I played it to avoid boredom. It's just very mechanical and not very inventive and lacks variety quite a bit. I think ND's A Thief's End did a much better job in this so I know they are capable of it. It's funny how people get swept up emotionally in the story to such an extent that they label the game ""Greatest Game Ever! (sniffle)"" .  It's like, buck up buckaroo. Don't let your emotions cloud your judgement and try to be objective. Anywho, good game and worth playing but slightly overrated IMO.,,8/10";normal;English;8
Beastside;Probably the single most overrated game of all time. First of all, linear games have got to be a thing of the past. They are simply so much worse than open-world games, for a variety of reasons. The art style is incredibly boring: you only see about two different colours in the entire game. The level design is laughably bad: alot of the time you can see that something is going to happen just by looking at how different dumpsters and barriers and so forth is set up. In that sense it reminded me of Gears of War or Doom, which are some of the most boring, repititive, mind-numbing games out there. The story is what makes this game special, but that's not sufficient to carry the whole game.;normal;English;7

Coochielover;Story was incredible, I even shed a tear or two in the end. The storytelling has action, love, hate, sadness, and conveys all the emotions convincingly. The gameplay portion is outdated but that’s to be expected playing a 2013/14 game in 2020. Graphics surprisingly keep up while not to TLOU2, it is totally acceptable.

DrZoidberg1995;Absolutely incredible. The story in this game was very emotional at times with so many twists and turns & it’s honestly one of the best games I’ve ever played. The voice acting, characters, story & graphics all come together to make something truly great. It’s nice to see Naughty Dog still putting so much time & effort into single player games when most of them have now moved on to live service games etc. I really couldn’t give this anything less than a 10 & would advise anyone to give this a try if they haven’t already.;normal;English;10

Sometimes you see someone you know in a vg character, but occassionally, you feel like you know the character, it has its own identity.

Nintenderek;"The Last of Us is a great survival horror game.  The levels are great.  The story is fantastic.  The characters are unique and interesting.  The graphics and sound are really awesome.  One thing about this game however that I feel doesn't get enough praise is the gampplay.  Whenever anyone talks about this game, it's usually about the story, but the gameplay itself here is pretty top notch with some pretty smart NPCs as you get further into the game.  The ""zombies"" (they are never referred to as that in the game) are also interesting and some can be quite difficult.

Although the gameplay is shallow, it attracts with its ease of development and complexity in skill. The last of Us on the ps3 used all the features of the console, which the Last of Us does not do on the ps4. The only things that were added in this remaster are minor visual improvements, dlc and slightly redesigned tactility of the gamepad.

Markos-;It's no surprise this game is loved by the vast majority of players and leaves a deep mark behind it. It's narrative power lies on a fairly cinematic touch and mysterious, engaging characters surviving an incredibly detailed apocalyptic world. It really is immersing and also scary at times. Exploration feels real and it forces you to measure every step. It's violence seems as real as everything else, and feels justified in an environment where life matters little to most.,,The gameplay is fun and challenging (TLOU 2 did not change it for a reason!), and I believe this game should be played if you haven't done it yet!;normal;English;9

The soundtrack is another great thing about this game, it adds the the sad but hope full atmosphere that the game give off and makes the game feel complete. And finally, the ending, we don’t have to talk about how perfect this game’s ending is because everyone who has played the game knows how good it is.

smb111;"A Masterpiece. The characters, the storytelling, and the world Naughty Dog built was incredible. I played on the PS3, then the PS4, and then on the hardest setting. For such a cruel, almost depressing world, I never wanted to leave it over the years. Perhaps that was because of the small nuggets of absolute beauty that were smattered throughout the game. And the love between the characters in the game. Another thing that really rang true for this game wasn't even the undead (clickers/runners/etc.), although those were terrifying enough. But honestly, it was the evil and cruelty that came from humans, our lowest points as civilization tore down around us that made the game feel authentic. Even the ""best"" characters had a dark side, and secrets from the past that they didn't want to share, or didn't want to recall because what they did to survive was so horrible...it almost took away their humanity. The story, and the choices of the main characters are deep enough to make you have to think. Thinking, particularly in a game focused on storytelling, is the key to a beautiful game. The characters, their interactions, and even the end of this game leave you thinking about a great many things: What would you be willing/unwilling to do in the same situation? What would people do if civilizations crumbled around them? Are there good and bad people, or just people? Would you be willing to...well, I won't ruin the end of the game. You'll have to play and find the answers to that question yourself. :),,Again, beautiful game, and a masterpiece!";normal;English;10

Same goes for the ps4 version, both versions have the same pros and cons in my opinion, since i had on both versions bugs that were frustrating and triggered me, i also had an incredible experience.

EdwardG;The Last of Us starts with one of its best sequences. Seeing the beginning of the outbreak through the eyes of a scared little girl was extremely compelling - the panic and confusion in this tense opening was truly great.,,Things slow down a little after the time jump, and it feels less gripping for a while. After spending some time with Ellie and Joel, however, it becomes clear why this game is held in such high regard. Seeing the relationship between the two main characters develop is what made me want to keep playing. They're well written, and the game does a good job making you care for them. Although the story and setting aren't very original, the narrative is still quite strong thanks to it's tone and, again, the characters.,,The gameplay is fun for the most part, but there are some annoyances like the clickers that can kill you in one hit until you've unlocked a certain upgrade. There's a lot of just walking around slowly too, but it's not much of a problem because this is still a very pretty game despite being a remaster of a last gen release, and the sights of The Last of Us are often worth slowing down to see. It's not all slow paced though, and there are some great action setpieces including one where you flank a sniper, and then use his weapon to defend your allies. The ending is great too, as it's action packed and you're given some strong motivation to fight in those final moments of the game.,,I loved Left Behind, the DLC that comes bundled with the PS4 remaster. It was another tense experience filled with emotion and more excellent character work. It does some different things with the mechanics of the game, using it's systems in charming new ways to help convey Ellie and Riley's relationship.,,Overall, I liked The Last of Us Remastered a lot, but I do think the moment to moment gameplay could've been better. There's a lot of moving about slowly, and although the combat can feel nice and visceral, the stealth and action gameplay isn't on the same level as the game's characters, narrative and performances, which are fantastic. These elements make this a great cinematic experience that fans of narrative driven games will surely enjoy.;normal;English;8
WHITESIXOMAR;This game blew my mind on ps3, then the remastered version for ps4 made me appreciate the experience so much more at 60 frames at polished gameplay.

aidaaaaaan_;The Last of Us is a gripping piece of art that tells a wonderfully crafted story with well written characters and their relationships with each other - specifically Joel and Ellie’s relationship shaping as the game goes on-. This game doesn’t only tell a wonderful story, but the gameplay complements the world and environment perfectly. When engaging in a melee fight with another human, you feel like you the player and the NPC are fighting for their life. When engaged in a gun fight, your lack of ammo you most likely have really encapsulates the apocalypse setting the game has. The gameplay doesn’t tend to get repetitive, as unlocked new weapons and equipment throughout will clear that issue up, giving you fresh gameplay every so often. All in all, a solid 9/10, a masterpiece in storytelling and character.;normal;English;9
watchm824;This is a great game. It is a pity that I only got acquainted with this game in 2020. But even now she made a great impression on me. I can't say that this game has some amazing plot or great gameplay. I was impressed by the atmosphere and characters.;expanded;English;10

CuppaFueled;Nerd Notes: I played this on a PS4 Pro using the framerate prioritisation mode, Standard Dualshock 4 controller, sitting a little over 8 feet from a 55” 1080p Samsung TV, for audio I used Bose AE2i Headphones, dynamic range setting was set as wide as possible for more immersion & I played on Normal difficulty.,,It’s 2020 and whilst I spend allot of time last year playing through all 5 Uncharted titles on PS4. I have never played The Last of us. Bars & expectations were exceedingly high for this 2013 masterpiece & If anything I was scared if this game was going to have aged well in 2020.,Story: Just when it feels as though we’ve had every ‘zombie’ story, The Last of Us swings a mean right hook and hits you with a story that’s not only damn right brilliant.,,The main characters: Joel & Ellie performed by Troy Baker & Ashley Johnson are some of the most polished & interesting characters I’ve ever had the pleasure to game as, I don’t want to give much away so I won’t go into more detail. But Joel & Ellie are not the end of this story, the supporting characters as well as factions are so memorable & brilliantly executed, games in 2020 still don’t have it as good as this!,,As you traverse the world you come across notes which add a whole new dimension to the game, letting you know that there are far more survivors out there. In most games I find notes like these to add very little to the story, but in The Last of Us it just makes you appreciate how vast,The story stands.,,The Last of us’ story sparks curiosity. Meaning not all stories are rounded off, it leaves you with questions, which is a good thing! So much media tries to round off every story told and sell it off as ‘fan service’ but I’m a big fan of how I would go to bed at night after playing The Last of Us and wondering what was going to happen, how something might have happened & what would it be like if this happened instead! That is a testament to how great this game’s story is, it sticks with you long after putting the controller down.,,Gameplay:  I was surprised how well The Last of Us still plays, the shooting I found to be a little rickety at the start, but as you upgrade throughout the story shooting becomes allot more fluid (I’m also an arse when it comes to shooting generally, which doesn’t help).,,Resorsed such as ammo are limited in The Last of Us, but did find it frustrating that not all enemies (who definitely carried guns) seemingly had no ammo when taken down.. I could understand this in more hardcore difficulty settings, but felt it was a little ‘forced’ It did however force me to play differently, use different weapons, techniques etc. so it’s swings and roundabouts.,,I knew going in that there was allot of stealth involved but I was happy that should you get spotted it doesn’t alert every enemy to your location, you’re able to takedown and hide which was great! Something we still don’t see enough of in 2020!,,I enjoyed the puzzle solving, there was a tasteful amount, without running into puzzles left, right & centre.,,I mentioned earlier that The Last of Us sparks curiosity, this remains true in all aspects, every building you enter there is usually a good reward for going off the track to explore, I did allot of exploring and still have so much more to see & I cannot wait for my next playthrough!,,Graphics:,,You know what? Even by today’s standards… this is a very pretty game! The textures were tac sharp, shadows were crispy fresh & the animation was the stellar quality you expect from Naughty Dog!,,I had a few times where aliasing was a thing, but this was just a very inherent issue for the PS3/360 era of gaming so I can’t judge too harshly for that, plus if I had a higher resolution TV and used the favour resolution mode I’d suspect this would have been less noticeable.,,The game looks great, I really don’t know what else to say, It was ahead of it’s time visually when it released in 2013 and I think it’ll remain pretty timeless because everything is just so well done!,,Sound/Music: The music really glues the elements of this game together, it’s got this raw naturalistic, striped back & built up vibe which seamlessly fits into the world of The Last of Us.,,The sound design is very good! It goes for a more neutral stance, (Rant: I’m not a fan of games where someone is talking to you from the other side of the room & it sounds like they’re right in your earhole). However when characters are far away you hear the reverberation of the voice more than the direct source which really transports you to the environments you’re exploring!,,Conclusion: If for whatever reason you’ve not played The Last of Us, I recommend that you do!,It’s on the ‘Playstation Hits’ so in the UK its around £15 and often goes on sale, it’s a game you definitely won’t want to miss out on.;normal;English;10

Gorehound;This game is just jaw dropping for all the right reasons too bad I can't say the same for the sequel.,,The Last Of Us has an amazing story with characters that you give a damn about, set in a world that has fallen to a pandemic that has caused the majority of people to become ravenous zombie like infected and any other human survivors you come across who can either be hostile or allies you play as Joel who has been tasked to take Ellie to a group who believe she is key to saving humanity.,,The gameplay is really good can be a bit rough the edges at times but is not a major issue, the graphics of the game are really good at showing a world that is in ruins due to a pandemic and not many games can capture that feeling of long forgotten world like this game did the character's in the game each have depth and story to tell there are moments in the game that can be heart wrenching at times but I won't go into to spoilers but all in all this game was really fun to play and was a hell of trip to take from start to finish the game was everything I expected from a single player story driven game;normal;English;9

drcoomer;"I'm super late to the party on this one, I know. But with a game THIS good, I had to jump in and write this review. I'm actually writing this a month after finishing TLOU and TLOU II so it's not super fresh in my mind. But not many games have stuck with me like this one so I'm going to do my best.,,Graphics: 10/10,I remember playing this game for about 30 minutes on my older brother's PS3 when the game first game out. I was 17 at the time and I remember being so impressed with the scene with Joel and Tommy in the truck and being able to move side-to-side and look out the windows at all the carnage. I know today that's probably not a very groundbreaking feature, but back then I was super impressed and it stuck with me for 7 years until I finally bought and played the remastered version myself. That's just a little personal tidbit that carried some weight with me. All in all, the graphics are stunning from start to finish and every cut scene feels as if it's way ahead of its time. Absolutely nothing to complain about there.,,Narrative: 10/10,Engaging, heart-wrenching, terrifyingly beautiful.,It is the heaviest story I've ever experienced in a video game and one of the only games that truly left me shook. It absolutely ripped me apart, and after the credits rolled I just sat there for about 10 minutes in silence. A lot of TV shows and movies should take notes!,,Protagonist: 10/10,Joel and Ellie will forever be two of my favorite characters in any piece of media. i could probably fill the rest of my 5000 character limit on this section alone. But I will leave it at that.,,Characters/Interactions: 10/10,The side characters that we are introduced to all effectively carry their own weight within the narrative. They are woven in and out of the story beautifully and each leave a punctual mark on your experience.,,Villain: 10/10,There's a lot to unpack regarding the ""villain"" of this game and who/what that actually is, but I want to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible so I won't get into it much. Some people say its ABC and some say it's XYZ, and that's fine. Discourse is a good thing! But again, this goes back to the writing and ND's ability to draw these discussions out that makes this game so amazing.,,Editing/cut scenes: 10/10,Perfectly done. My jaw literally dropped and I gasped audibly at one point towards the beginning of the game (I think those of you who have played it know what I'm talking about). Everything about the editing is A+. The voice acting is superb (ILY Ashley Johnson). The little details like voice cracks, deep breaths, long pauses really make these scenes feel REAL and the conversations feel authentic. There's a sense of gravity in every single cut scene and it just gets heavier and heavier as the game goes on, and honestly, it's exhausting. And I mean that in the best way possible.,,Gameplay: 10/10,It's a pretty simple style. Hide and shoot. But it's effective and not once did it get boring. The lack of ammo makes it that much harder and sometimes you have to really be creative. Playing from multiple points-of-view really adds to the experience as well.,,All in all, this game is about as perfect as it can get. It resonates with me to this day and I don't think I could say a bad thing about it if I tried. Bravo, Naughty Dog!,,Overall Score: 10/10";normal;English;10
muffinpro25;Returning to this game hurts because you see how far Naughty Dog has fallen from grace. While painful at times this story is hopeful and full of love. The graphics at the time were incredible and still look really good today. At the time nobody could touch Naughty Dog in terms of cinematic story telling in video games and that's why it hurts to see the sequel to this game. However this game isn't tainted for me, it's still a masterpiece in my eyes and always will be. Everyone who owns a Playstation needs to play this game.;normal;English;10
AboIbrahiem;One of the best games ever made. Story, gameplay, graphics and sound are absolutely perfect. I'm just really sad about how the sequel turned out.;expanded;English;10
YaBoiFirmi;Okay now, I know i’m 7 YEARS late but sadly i wasn’t aware of this website and all but i still want to share my thoughts about this game. Okay Where do i begin, let’s obviously begin with the beginning to where you have this guy who is named Joel and his daughter Sarah and them having a funny and nice father daughter moment together. The game then has you waking up as Sarah and man the rest of it what happens is just amazing. The game throws you into chaos almost immediately with sadly having you see Sarah dying in Joel’s arms. That scene was so good, but also so sad that i actually shed a tear and not a lot of games do that to me but man this game actually made me shed a tear which is awesome now looking back on it. You then see Joel become this smart individual who plays every situation smart and is always cautious about LITERALLY everything and how he does lots of smuggling behind the government’s back. You also get to meet his friend Tess to which is a very underrated character. You then get to meet Ellie to which after playing this game  TONS and TONS of time, Ellie is hands down the most awesome and just a well developed character out of the whole game. I love how Joel and Ellie’s relationship starts out suspicious of one another and not really caring about each other but they eventually develop this father daughter relationship which is just beautiful. Now even though the story is predictable and all its okay because the dialogue in between cutscenes and just in general make up for it. There are no throw away characters and all of them are interesting and serve a purpose. The environments in the world is just amazing and beautiful and to be honest, I would LOVE to be apart of the world too. The also loved how you learn more about the fireflies and the “cure” to which yes the “cure” was not guaranteed and the fireflies have also failed numerous times in making a cure. The game then throws you a twist to where Joel is injured and you take control of Ellie. That to me is beautiful writing and a really nice twist. This also helps develop Ellie’s character even more too. However, i did run into some glitches here and there but none of the glitches i found were game breaking or annoying. They were honestly just really funny and I didn’t even mind them. Also, the multiplayer i did not play a-lot in but i will say that with the little time i got with it, i REALLY enjoyed my time and was honestly just fun. Now I would say that i hope there is a sequel and how happy i would be with it. But as I am making this review, there is already a sequel out to which I have already given my review with it. All in all though, this a great game with beautiful graphics for its time, great storytelling, great characters, and just great all around in pretty much every part of this game.;normal;English;10

salmansohail_;The remastered title gives just as content as the previous title but with improved graphics, animations and physics. The Last of Us: Remastered deserves more praise then any other game of this generation.,,Maybe we may not have really needed a port so quickly, but then again, The Last of Us isn’t just any game. As one of the best games of all-time, the more places it is and the more people that can play it, the better. One of the best new features of TLOU:R is the extensional larger framerate. The game displays at 1080p60. The game excellent. The story phenomenal. The game did something that no other game has for me and that is it tugged at me emotionally. Naughty Dog excels at giving games a cinematic feel.,,I feel as if Naughty Dog puts more effort in to there games then any other developer. This is what every developer should be like. Not some rehash broken game (IW, Hello Games).The game also comes with DLC. Who wouldn't want a game with an extra story??,,Verdict:,,The Last of Us: Remastered is just as amazing as the original if not better. The game didn't just throw the game over to the next generation title and give it some pretty new details. It improved upon physics. Fixed bugs. Listened to fans. Gave it a staggering frame rate increase and overall just made it the best game of the year.

outlawX357;compared to the original this game lacks so much of the heart, character development, world building, and relate ability. Not to mention the game mechanics have not changed all that much so while familiar doesn't feel innovative.

lordjovac;One of the most acclaimed games of all time is also the one I dreaded playing the most. I dont care for zombies and although I like Uncharted series I was never a huge fan. Now, just before the release of its long awaited sequel, I finally decided to give The Last of Us a go and...I absolutely loved every minute of it. It is visually a gorgeous game with one of the finest depictions of post apocalyptic society I have ever seen. It is a slower and more somber game than I expected, but never boring. It mixes genres flawlessly and thus it avoids feeling repetitive. Gameplay is nothing groundbreaking. Its your standard 3rd person cover shooter but it succesfully implements different weapons, tools and stealth system so you always have a variety of ways to tackle each situation. The stars of the game are, however its story and characters. It may be set during zombie outbreak but its a story about love, loss and hope and its characters are so beautifully written its only a matter of time before you get teary eyed. Beautiful, emotional, well written and exciting. Masterpiece.;normal;English;10

HRChan;This is a beautiful game about family in a post-apocalyptic setting, the start really gets me every time I see it the death of Sara will never not hurt. Then seeing Joel after 20 years, how and what he does to survive, meeting Ellie, then that starts the journey that we will never forget. The dynamic between these two characters was hardly there at the start of the game, but throughout their journey they become close like a real father and daughter. Hence the talk of the game, the ending, was it a good choice or a bad choice to do that ending? For me, it's a great ending and should've left it at that.;normal;English;10

FlipNog;One of the best games I've played in a while.,,Narrative driven games such as this one are my favorite types of game, the two main characters, Joel and Ellie, are so well written and consistent in their dialogue, I feel connected with these characters as If knew them at some point. The story is fantastic, I'm not going to spoil it, obviously, but it's great.,,The gameplay is also great, the stealth kill animation to strangle is obnoxiously long is basically my only gripe gameplay-wise. A small immersion breaker is the ai for your companions. If you are sneaking around being quiet your companion will run at full speed towards you, it doesn't alert enemies because you're not making the noise but it's only a nitpick. The DLC is fine, it didn't add too much to the story, just kinda explained some things.,,When a game has me thinking about it weeks later, still going through my mind, again and again, that's how I know I was really enveloped in the story. A must-play for ps4 owners.;normal;English;9

As a parent, I can’t say I’d do any different, but as a scientist, I am conflicted. This game is a masterpiece.;normal;English;10

BellaYoko;Only played this recently to get the backstory for the sequel, but holy crap this was an amazing ride! I hope this gets adapted into a movie or a TV show soon! As a creative writing major, I loved the story, and how it handled moral ambiguity and what loss does to a person. A mix of a tragic western and a great drama. Graphics hold up well too, for a game 7 years old. Gameplay is fun and challenging, and I love how it makes you feel so human, and not a super powered or peak level performing beast of a superhero. It all feels so real. I highly recommend it to everyone. You owe it to yourself to play this and the sequel at least once in your life.;normal;English;10
LEGENDARY_POWER;Game was good but nothing special. I expected something more unique in story and also I ve got problem to get use to to gameplay. It was really archaic.;expanded;English;8
Luigichief;I played this game in early 2019 and I didn't like it at all, but in July 2020 I replayed it entirely and changed my opinion. The first time I played the game I was shoot all my way through it, I didn't use stealth once (brick and bottle none at all) and maybe that's why I didn't think the gameplay was any good, just a shooter that you need to save ammo on. In my second game I was about 90% stealth, I was trying to get through each mission without using a bullet, just sneaking between enemies, with bricks, bottles and a little of melee. Exploration is very rewarding and almost essential to the game. I thought that playing more in the stealth gives an air of survivor and contributed to my immersion, but this is very personal (except that personally I found the normal way too easy). The game has a very realistic air but for gameplay sake, there are a lot of things that aren't.,,The story is very simple and basic (in my first game I went with **** up hype and I was quite frustrated with it). It is a journey, from point A to point B (what can be considered a differential is that point B changes) that has the objective of saving the world. But for me this is not the good part of the game, as most people say (I believe that they express themselves wrong), but rather focus on the characters, their stories (backgrounds), their growth, their interactions and their relationships . But seriously, what the script does half-heartedly in the story it makes up for in all aspects of the characters and I believe that was the goal. So don't play this game expecting a complex story, totally unpredictable, epic, full of twists or something. But even without any of this, it is very immersive and you want to see what will happen next and all this thanks to the characters (the story even had 2 events that were unpredictable and they were good). But the only part that I really liked about the story was the ending. He's very unexpected and dark, I liked him a lot, but in the end he ends up being the merit of the characters too. Another thing that didn't really please me was the timeskips, it gave an air of history and a certain skip team “skipped” all the consequences of certain deaths and how they affected Joel and Ellie. And I never thought I would say that but the direction of this game is very good and very smart, it manages to provide the best experience possible in the cutscenes. The dialogues that take place while you explore are something that I really liked (especially at the beginning of the game, then unfortunately they decrease a lot). The level design of this game is very good, the scenarios are very detailed, full of personality and therefore are very immersive.,,The characters in general are very complex and well humanized, everyone has their defects and make mistakes. But the really good characters are Joel and Ellie, because they are the protagonists they have a lot of focus, are very deep, have cool interactions to see and have a nice development. For me they practically carried the game on their backs.,,The soundtrack is ok. The dubbing is excellent and so are the sound effects.,,The diversity of 'zombies' is very low, there are 3 types of zombies (you can't even compare with Left for Dead for example). Another thing that bothered me a bit is that there are no boss fights in the game. Even in 2020 the game in the remastered edition (v1.10 if I'm not mistaken) still has bugs, which I found very strange. But this game is very overrated and for me it is definitely not the best of the decade, generation or something.;normal;English;8

DrSuess;This has to be one of if not the best games of all time. The story of loss, sacrifice, hope and finally redemption speaks to an audience that has been deprived of these aspects in current popular culture films and games. The relationship between a broken man, and his rough sarcastic traveling companion is excellent. In the end I grew to accept that every person that faces these challenges could do evil things, but they can find they are not without the ability to still do the right thing. He made the right call in the end, every father out there knows he did. 10/10 no question;normal;English;10

blurryface197;"(English is not my mother language so excuse the spelling mistakes) This is surely one of the best games ever, so far my favorite, played it for the first time on the PS3 and then bought it again for the PS4, the enhanced quality make it looks great even today and I wish there could be another remastered version for the upcoming PS5. As far as game play goes this (with the Uncharted series) is one of my favorite, not to mention the amazing acting, music and all the tech side in general. But where this game shine is in storytelling and characters. The game play per se is a 3rd person shooting/stealth game in an apocalyptic zombie world, what makes it special are the story and the characters. Even the ones you see just for a small part of the game are unforgettable, not to mention the two main characters which, to me, represent the best game characters I've ever seen in a video game, with such a special relationship that made me fell in love with them as if they were real. Witnessing the change of both Joel and Ellie throughout their journey is an unique experience, seeing how all the walls Joel built around himself for the past 20 years melt little by little in the year he and Ellie spent together is truly an amazing achievement as fas as character growth in a video game of roughly 12 hours. Also the ending, which put not only Joel but us as players, in a moral dilemma where you ask yourself if the choice he made was right or wrong is what make this game amazing. And when the credit rolls, and in your mind you can still see Ellie's doubting face and the echo of her ""ok"" is still fresh you still wonder what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong and what anyone of us would have done in Joel's shoes. The Last of Us is one of those experience people will cherish forever, like it happens with special books, movies, tv shows and music. It become part of our lives and something that will stay with us. And even if the story is dark, violent and gory there's always a spark of light and hope throughout it. Thanks to Naughty Dog for bringing to life this masterpiece and creating such amazing characters.";normal;English;10
piuscorvus;I have never been a fan of games with horror zombie apocalypse topics. I played some of them such as The Evil Within games, tried one Resident Evil game and few others. The common thing for all those games (in my opinion) was that they are very successful in making you scared and uncomfortable but when it comes to the storylines - they were all so thin and weak, sometimes even pointless. I am fine with gore and fear but if that is the only point in the game then I do not find it really interesting.,I have been avoiding playing The Last of Us because I thought it is just another zombie game but when I finally started playing I saw after two hours of gameplay that this game is completely different. This is the first game with such topic (zombie outbreak) that I liked and it definitely is the best game with zombies and one of the best games that I have ever played and that is because it only uses the zombie apocalypse as an atmosphere in which context lies a story about Joel, the adult and Ellie, fourteen year old girl, who are on their journey through the country. The game puts an accent on the story and does not have a gameplay based on infinite shooting at zombies, or how they call them in the game, infected. It is far from that but the gameplay is far from a piece of cake and it should also satisfy gamers who are into action and shooting, especially if they select harder difficulty modes.,I played both PS3 and PS4 version of this game and visually it is one of the best looking games for PS3. Even in 2020, 7 years after it was released, this game still looks very nice being put next to some other good looking PS4 titles. The PS4 remastered version has a little visual improvements such as full HD resolution and more fps.,Speaking of a gameplay, The Last of Us does not bring many innovations - it rather improves some stuff that we already saw in third person action-adventure games. The gameplay perfectly combines exploration and combat with cutscenes without overdoing each of those. You can play this game in many ways. You can be aggressive and shoot everything at your sight but you can also sneak and be quiet. There are many ways of passing through the areas and for the most part you can really choose if you want to assassinate your enemies or find a way around.,Through the game you will find different sorts of weapons and there is a crafting system allowing you to make improvised bombs and melee weapons.,Another part of a gameplay is walking and exploration followed by interesting dialogs.,The Last of Us has a very fine acting, one of the best I saw in video games, which an emotional story of this game certainly needs, a story that most of the players would breathlessly follow until the end.;normal;English;10
asadrocky;"I've always believed ""nothings perfect,"" then I played this game. The Last of Us is, at its core, a simple story/narrative told flawlessly.  The story is about the relationship between Joel and Ellie which is developed flawlessly and at a perfect pace through well-timed story beats, relatable dialogue, environmental storytelling, and even combat. Moments of darkness are offset by moments of light, both that contribute to the narrative. Every single side character Joel and Ellie come across strengthens their personal motivations, their bond, all while having a believable arc of their own. Combat fits the world perfectly, and Ellie's scrappiness is conveyed perfectly through how she develops during combat sequences. The development of Joel and Ellie's father/surrogate daughter relationship feels very real, relatable, and honest, and the ending will have you asking yourself morally complex questions. This is the greatest story ever told by video games, T.V shows, and even movies.";normal;English;10

This game provides one of the best stories ever written in video gaming history, in my opinion.

Another aspect of the game that stuck out to me was the combat.

For someone that has been out of the loop in terms of gaming since Nintendo Wii, I was still hearing a lot of praise for this game. When I finally decided to get back into gaming and purchased my PS4, this is a no-brainer. I just had to play it and even with high expectations, I was still super impressed.,Obviously the best part of the game is the story.

Mrteeson;A perfect story telling game in a simplistic and realistic way that allows players to be involved with all characters. The graphics, sounds and level design are done well holistically that provides the best immersive gameplay experience. The 3rd person shooter gameplay itself is nothing special except a few moments throughout the game(similar to uncharted) but does the job to keep you going to the next cutscene. Overall you wont find a game like this for a while.

DrZombie;Great graphics and sound, outstanding soundtrack, unrivaled voice acting, solid game-play and controls, that alone would make for a great game, but what makes TLOU more than the sum of its parts is the storytelling, character development and pacing.,,This is probably as close to perfect as a game can get.;expanded;English;10
Ganderlow;This is a must play for anyone. A masterpiece that I will continue to replay throughout the years. The duo of Joel and Ellie is the best writing I've ever seen between two characters.

Mr_Pupps;Probably one of the greatest PlayStation exclusives if not games in general to ever exist... only reason I switched to PlayStation honestly. The story is great. The gameplay is great. The graphics aren’t great. It’s tone & mood & world are great. It’s been a long time since I fell in love with a game. Not to mention the multiplayer is super underrated. It’s a shame that many people don’t play it. Ocarina of time & Mario 64 was Nintendo 64s must haves. GameCube has windwaker and smash melee. Xbox has halo 1-3. Etc. this is one of those must haves. You have to play for yourself and get engaged into the world.  Its a masterpiece.;normal;English;10
DrKolbasa;This game was first one that I played on my PS4 and I definitely made a good choice. Good shooting, perfect storyline, but it have 2 major problems:,-Localisation.

LazyNinjaUK;The Last of Us was a truly great game when it was first released, immersive and beautifully ruined environments to traverse, pulse-pounding survival horror gameplay, and a story that really showed the potential for what narrative in video games could achieve. With the release of the remastered version, the visuals look even more beautiful and with the higher-frame-rate it made the somewhat clunky shooting much more playable. Whilst the crafting and environmental puzzle solving may be basic, the game tells a compelling story with great performances from its voice cast and leads the player through some iconic locations and set pieces. Few video games get you to care about its protagonists so much as The Last of Us gets you to care about Ellie and Joel.;normal;English;8
Realnoobman;Best dialogues ever, extremely good written story and characters, smart level design and gameplay is deeply immersive. AI not perfect.;expanded;English;8
Ichoras13;Highly amazing game. Not simply another zombie game. Theres story here and the gameplay and pacing are superb.

Hatooteh;Game is very overrated and doesn’t look that good for a remaster. It’s filled with cliches and it’s a pretty average zombie story. Gameplay is fun but it’s very glitchy and the puzzles consist of looking for a ladder.  Would be rated higher if wasn’t so overhyped because it can be fun at times.,Naughty dog knows nothing about guns.;expanded;English;5

The characters are excellent, the script is good and verified to the smallest detail, there are no extra scenes and extra characters. The graphics are on top. Level design is a role model. The companion in the game is not useless as in many games, moreover-over time, you just want him to be around and not disappear, worry about him.

Cjmolina007;One of, if not, the best game I have ever played thanks to the story, acting, and directing by everyone involved. Even some of the best films don't compare when it comes to Joel and Ellie. The adventure that these two go on is so haunting and yet beautiful that by the time you reach it's end, you'll put the controller down and think about what you just went through. I myself teared up couple of moments through out the game which I have never done in a video game. Truly my favorite game I have ever played and one that just needs to be played by everyone especially those who have a Playstation 4. Bravo for everyone at Naughty Dog and everyone who helped out bring this masterpiece to life.;normal;English;10
Justcritics;Just an Amazing Game! Wow. The Story is so great, the storytelling is great, the emotional stuff is Done so great one of my favorite Games of all Time.;expanded;English;10
ENDrain;First things first, I played on Grounded difficulty. I believe that a game shows it’s best on highest difficulty, when it challenges you so you somewhat feel the struggle the characters are going through.,,First things first, when I play a survival stealth, I expect to play a survival stealth.,,Apparently, when Naughty Dog decided to make a stealth game for once, no one from the studio bothered to actually go and play some stealth games to see how things are done.,,Because The Last of Us is a stealth game with the brains of a shooter. I mean, in this STEALTH game, once you alert one enemy, everyone knows your precise location forever after. (I only speak about human enemies, not the zombies).,,As if it weren’t enough, the bots are using aim-cheat. As if THIS weren’t enough, on some levels there are trigger-places that make enemies blitz to your location even if you’ve kept low profile ever before.,,I could’ve withstood the hive-mind human adversaries alone or the aim alone, but not both. And I know this game has lots of things to be liked, such as the performance, the level design, the world design, the animations, the pacing. The caracters and story are okay, nothing you couldn’t find in other games. But a videoGAME ought to have a decent GAMEplay. So, zero.;normal;English;0

Ideabox313;One of my favorite games on the PS4. The gameplay is average for a stealth-shooter setpiece type game (like Deus Ex), though it is better at the highest difficulties when you cannot use listen mode. I think one of the biggest drawbacks is that you can miss interesting dialog/interactions if you try to sneak past some areas, so I would end up always trying to kill every enemy.,The story is mostly predictable, but executed well. I think it is the small bits of dialog scattered throughout the gameplay that really helps to format emotional connections with the characters. This makes the big scenes pay off more.;normal;English;10

ERRORCODE-20;Tlou is nearly flawless in its storytelling. Characters are beautifully written and acted. My only gripe is that the gameplay itself is merely acceptable. It didn't have me wanting more of its gameplay. But still it's good enough for the game to not be boring on a first playthrough. Which is all the characters need to blow you away.;expanded;English;9

KarakACG;Just replayed the game and still one of the best games ever created, only surpassed by its successor now. A truly mesmerising and memorable tale with great characters, perfect pacing and strong emotions. This game will make you cry every time you play it again. It's a timeless classic that never gets old, even though Part 2 vastly improved on many areas of the game.,,Absolute must play for every gamer out there.;normal;English;10
GamingUnites;A story of love, family and finding a reason to believe in life again told in a dark, brutal setting.  Not something you see in gaming very often and virtually never in a AAA game.,,The narrative progresses at a moderate and believable pace, with characters one can easily identify and empathise with.,,Combine that with what was, at the time, great graphics and a good combination of heavy, visceral feeling gameplay mechanics (gunplay, melee and stealth) and you have a classic.,,60fps @ 1080 makes the game play smoother and far more responsive.  Play on Hard or Survival to get the most out of the survival horror theme.  Throw in the very good Left Behind DLC and you've got a must-buy for fans of the genre.,,If only the second game could have had an interesting story, instead of the bland revenge tale mixed with TV soap opera story-lines and erratic characters.  Such a waste.;normal;English;10

DandyDavid;Perfect. I can type out an entire essay on just the beginning scene. It hits emotional beats right on time after time. It’s characters feel as if they are real. Everyone and everything little about this world is complex with emotion, dedication, and detail. I can’t express how good this game honestly is. Everyone involved in the creation of this game is was perfect for it and insanely talented. Ashley Johnson is amazing with her performance of Ellie. Same as Troy Baker and literally everyone else. Neil Druckmann as proved to us that he is one of the best directors out there.;normal;English;10
Richardrake;Its a very cinematic experience that takes you trough a lot of emotions. All of this because of its well writed character and interesting story;expanded;English;9
PureWheel9;One of the best games I have ever played in my 17 years of playing video games. It isn't perfect, but it is as close to perfection as you could reasonable hope for. What is so special about this game is that while it does the storytelling part of it (story, characters, pacing, ambiance, music) so incredibly well, it doesn't do it to the detriment of its game play.;expanded;English;8
Kemp;This game isn't perfect, but it does some things so much better than any other video game I've ever played that it feels like it might as well be perfect. Because of that, I can't give it anything less than a 10.,,First, my critiques. At times, the level design is extremely linear. I don't just mean that there's no open world. I'm fine with that. I just mean that there is almost no room for flexibility in how you approach most levels.,,My only other critique is that it could have been longer. I don't just mean that it should have been longer for the sake of being longer (it took me about 15 hours to complete). I mean there was actually quite a lot of room for more. For example, I won't spoil the narrative, but when you finish the sequence in Pittsburgh, they jump cut to Jackson. I understand why, but to me it felt like there was a chapter missing. There was room, I think, for a chapter with character development / emotional unpacking somewhere on the trek between Pittsburgh and Jackson. Similarly, after Jackson, I thought there was also some room for another chapter. I don't think these would have derailed the story. Rather, I think adding more could actually have served to build upon the character development and set up some of the games big moments even better.,,That said, there is a reason why so many people think this game is a masterpiece, including me. The writing is so much better than almost any game I've ever played. It is better than 9 out of 10 Hollywood movies. The characters are complex, their emotions feel natural, and you really can't help but become emotionally invested in Joel and Ellie and many others you meet along the way. The game is so grounded and somehow makes you forget this is a zombie video game. These characters feel so real.  Finally, this is all punctuated by an ending that truly is as good as everyone says it is. That's all I'll say about that. You just need to experience it.,,Also, as a bonus, the DLC is actually incredible. It retains all the writing and voice acting quality of the main game. It's an amazing story on its own, but it perfectly builds on the main game too. I really can't recommend this game enough. While there is somehow actually room for improvement, this game took my breath away. For that, it gets a 10/10.;normal;English;10

Amuro_Rey;For me, these are some must-haves (based on the hierarchy of importance) for a good game:,1. A good story (that makes you want to continue playing) - carries the most weight,2. Good gameplay that keeps the game exciting,3. Good music that sets the atmosphere and overall mood,And a distant 4th which is graphics... it can provide an overall believability & realness to the game but to be honest, I have enjoyed many games with lousy graphics.,So, for Last of Us all in all:,1. good (compelling story, relationship and emotions),2. good (nice survival feel),3. good (nice ambience, sounds),4. good (it looks too good to be a PS3 game),I do not generally like games with less than 50hrs play-time, not to mention the zombie genre. But Last of Us changed my perception greatly. Saying that it is a zombie genre does not do it justice, it is unique.

CwB_Yokai;The Last of Us was a revolution on storytelling and video games. There`s a place before and there`s a place after TLOU. The character development in this game is priceless. Of course the story is the most important thing in this game, but it`s still a game, so let`s talk about the gameplay. TLOU give us a third person shotter with survival horror scenes, an action game with smooth gameplay. For the PS3 generation, it`s the best.;normal;English;10

BSquared;Recently re-played the game in preparation for TLOU2 and I have to say even after all those years this first part is a work of art. Yes the tech and graphics have aged, even though it was best in class upon release, but the story itself and the writing of the characters would already make this an 11/10. The story had me either smiling, crying or on the edge of my seat most of the time - and when was the last time a game had you crying because you were just caring about it‘s protagonists so much.,Fighting System and gameplay are smooth and never boring and the sound effects are just perfect to add the last bit of atmosphere.,A must have game.;normal;English;10
Tarington555;Just replayed after 3 years and playing part 2 (which I surprisingly didn't hate).,,Favorite game of all time... Nuff said. Only game that ever made me literally cry while playing and I knew what was gonna happen. Brilliant!!!;expanded;English;10

JBolt97;"I absolutely LOVED this game. Not only was the story very well written, none of the characters seemed ""pointless"" The pacing was also very good. Joel and Ellie have awesome chemistry. I say 9/10 because when I was playing, Joel and Ellie seemed to be a little clunky on the controls, little minor mishap. Also, I know the game is old at this point, but it does have some minor glitches. I feel as games should look at this game and take some notes. This is how you make a game! This is how you make an awesome story between two people!";normal;English;9
Thesweatynerd;My favorite game of all time. Great graphics. Incredible music. Ground breaking story telling and memorable characters. Everything else I didn't mention is great. Only flaw is some glitches, which keeps this from a perfect 10.;expanded;English;9
MuellerWI;The Last of Us delivers an excellent story experience. While the gameplay is simple and gets a bit stale by the end, the story sucks you into Joel and Ellie's relationship. Seeing Joel and Ellie's relationship develop throughout the game is what drives you to keep playing.;expanded;English;8
ADCT800;Nice game. The story is what.make it special. The gameplay is not that special but it has interesting mechanics. I think it is a poor port because it looks exactly like a PS3 game just with better frame rate.;expanded;English;8
JayLando22;"I have not played it since it first came out and with some distance, I got to see how my feelings about the game have changed.,,At the time I thought the ending painted Joel as the anti-hero but playing it again in 2020 and watching the first ten minutes of that game I changed my feelings. The game tells a very simple ""Dad video game"" plot though very ahead of its time but might accidentally be saying something profound about the failure of systemic leadership.,,Anyway, the beginning really set up the ending but I am not sure if it is intentional because the writing in this game is so bad. I think at the time before Uncharted 4 I appreciated that they were trying to fix the ludo narrative dissonance by making everyone a murder sociopath in a murder world. Compared to Uncharted it seemed clever but ultimately it is pretty shallow.,,The audio and visuals still hold up. The guns sound good and the narrow corridor level design does look really nice, even if you can see its Crash Bandicoot roots.,,I liked it enough then, I still like it now, but other than all the time and money spent on the audio and visuals and animations and VO, it really never really rises as something special, just expensive.";normal;English;6

DOLLAR_376;The remaster of The Last of Us is how remasters in general should be done. The game is obviously the same, one of the best games of all time, but it has graphical updates and it runs at 60fps, which should be a standard for all gaming by now. As a result, the experience is even better and more fluid, improving on an already solid game.;expanded;English;10

Due_Offer;Yes I know this review is seven years late but for a completely unrelated reason I thought I'd bob over here and post one. The game isn't complex (Start here, go there, stay alive), it's certainly not original (every bodies dead, two people meet, bad situation, bond), the game isn't long (can be done in two numb bums), seriously it's all been done before! It's even got glitches.,,What makes this one of the all time classics though is just how well every little insignificant moment keeps you invested. The charisma of the characters draws you in and every tidbit of new dialogue pulls you further in to the story. The environmental storytelling is well worth mentioning, I really felt for Ish and he's not even in the game! By design or possibly mistake the momentum and timing is kept just right to instantly sweep you up and keep you going throughout your entire play-through.,,Your invested in these characters every step of the way, so when something threatens them your going to do something about it. When they are separated you are going to bring them back together. When they are on their own your going to keep them safe. It's truly beautiful just how much you get to know and love your characters and personally feel what they are going through.,,I found I got more enjoyment out of the game the harder the difficulty. This isn't a shooter and it isn't a stealth game, it's an 'Oh my god we're going to die, do something!' kind of game. If you have enough ammo and resources are plentiful your on the wrong difficulty setting, trust me. Play the game as a coward, run away from hunters, avoid infected and scavenge like a hoarder.,,Combat can only be described as meaty, there's no glory in it, you only ever fight to stay alive. It's basic and it's brutal, exactly how it should be. Joel and Ellie swing wildly, shoot blindly and run for their lives most the time. You'll hear Ellie say that was intense on more than one occasion, you'll agree.,,I am of course making this review at a time when a lot of discussion is taking place about a game closely modelled on this one. I bought the original version on PS3, I bought the remaster same day as my PS4, it's seven years later and I'm still playing it. It's a powerful game and one I advise you to play yourself. If you do beat it, get it on Grounded mode for the replay, leave your R1 button alone.;normal;English;10

ultraminecraft;The Last of Us: Remastered is a remaster done right. The visuals, audio and framerate are all improved. Another big change with the remaster is the addition of the DLC, Left Behind. Left Behind is okay, definitely not as good as the base story but that is to be expected from a 4-6 hour long DLC. I would highly recommend anyone looking into playing The Last of Us to pick up this remaster.;expanded;English;9
tinyamricanflag;"I came back to play this one recently, before the sequel came out. It's still a great game, and the remaster definitely looks noticeable better than the PS3 original. The story, plot-wise is a fairly generic zombie post-apocalypse where the other survivors are more dangerous than the zombies. On the other hand, the characters and how they interact with each other and the world around them is what makes the games narrative special. Joel and Ellie's relationship is at the forefront of this and the writers did an amazing job with them. The voice acting for most of the characters is spot on. The game play is pretty good, not great. Its somewhat clunky and slow at times, especially during combat. After playing the sequel and its refinements to these systems, it felt so off and less intuitive in this one, but nothing deal breaking. This one may or may not be better than the sequel depending on several factors present in the sequel. I cant recommend one over the other but this one plays it ""safer"" with its story.";normal;English;9
BigBoss2203;The Last of Us is a masterpiece. Back when Naughty Dog knew what they were doing and could still write characters well, we got this game. The graphics still hold up very well, enemy design is creative. Gameplay is sort of standard, but is so polished to perfection that it always feels fluid.,The story is what sells it though. Along the way you will meet characters that are more than just bullet sponges there to die unceremoniously. They all display how 'normal' people might react when the world is ravaged by this infection, and all of them have small, but meaningful arcs that make them so memorable and impactful. I wish the sequel followed this example, and realised that it's easy to kill off people out of nowhere, but more important to make characters sympathetic and relatable, few moments made me as sad as the ending of 'summer'. The ending is an interesting dilemma, too. I believe it's a great reflection of Joel's arc and it made the journey more meaningful than the destination. Screw The Last of Us 2. Praise this game!;normal;English;10
JaneyD;"Naughty Dog really nailed the perfect marriage of what makes a game great for me with Last of Us. A wonderful balance of sombreness and levity, action and stillness, ugliness and beauty. Super strong character development with the few characters who weren’t downright likeable and that had you heavily invested in keeping them alive, at least being intriguingly compelling and disturbingly human. Great graphics, solid movesets that cleverly changed with the characters requiring gamers to adapt, comfortably intuitive controls/menus, a good balance of led gameplay and really being able to take on the game in your own way and an absolutely stunning soundtrack made it a joy to play. My biggest complaint would be the ""ally"" AI which is always getting in the way or blocking where you are trying to go but my enjoyment of the rest of the game was such that I'm still willing to award top marks. I loved playing this game, getting to know these characters and being a part of this journey and have replayed it several times. Last of Us will forever be a firm favourite.";normal;English;10
darknightserg;The remaster of The Last of Us does it justice with enhances graphics and smoother frame rate. The Last of Us is one of the beat ps exclusives far none.

A lot of messages are being brought to you without being on your nose about it. The character bonding is the best in the industry and the (for the time stellar) graphics help elevate it all. I can advise anyone who wants to keep this game positively in their heart, please please please, stay far away form the last of us part 2. For anyone who is able to completely shut of their brain and just wanna run around and shot, part 2 is an option to waste your time.;normal;English;10

It deserves this rating and will go down in video gaming history as one of the best story driven games out there!,If only TLOU part 2 had been as good...;normal;English;10
Armin4;It's in my top 10,I love every second of it,I fell the characters,And Joel is one the best characters in history;expanded;English;10
Lensten;The game is perfect.,After 20 min of playing, the game already shocked me... no other game was able to do this.;expanded;English;10
pigjedi;Had to come back to review this game after my review of TLOF2.,What made this game incredible was the story and characters. The gameplay and graphics were top notched for it's time. The multiplayer was also really fun.,,I still remember the feeling of completing this game a few years ago. I stared at Ellie's sad face, knowing Joel lied, and cried. This game was a 10/10 for me;expanded;English;10
sable10;Still one of my all-favorite games in my lifetime. This is more than a game, honestly. It’s a true masterpiece. A game I would easily replay.;expanded;English;10
DatSpaceBoi;It's such a perfect narrative game by Naughty Dog ! You will go through many different emotions throughout your adventure, but beware, as a post-apocalyptic adventure game, it won't be a happy walk in a desolate park.,With that said, I can't compare it with the second game right now, which other players may do at the moment.,But if you want a cruel and yet, beautiful experience facing many dangers like bandits, creepy mushroom-heads zombies (?) taking place in various locations in the U.S it should be for you.,This edition comes with sharper graphics and better framerate, a DLC campaign where you play Ellie, and probably more multiplayer stuff, since this game has indeed a multiplayer, but I didn't play much of it, even back on PS3.,Gameplay wise it's still pretty good, even though, I would have liked a little more liberty in my approaches. You can't enter rooms and just shooting everything that moves like Uncharted and it's a nice change : prepare yourself, craft Molotov cocktails and medikits, check your ammo and try to remain hidden until your ennemy walks into your trap. It can be found for cheap in stores and during sales since it's part of Playstation Hits.,It was a must have on PS3, and it's even more one on PS4 !;normal;English;10

ElBruno;The last of us is a fantastic game with a very good story and exceptional character development. The gameplay and graphics are very good for a 2013 game. The soundtrack is just incredible. The only less strong point is the AI ​​of the npcs because they simply have x-ray vision and from the moment an enemy sees you, everyone knows about you.,Still, it is one of the best games ever in my opinion.;normal;English;10

LostGreenie;This is a masterpiece. I mean, I litterally bought a ps4 to play this game. The story is so well written and the characters so compelling. The performances of Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker are stunning and the ost is magnificent.,,Gameplaywise, it is a lot of fun (even if the allies can sometimes get in your way or run around while you're concentrating on this oh so dangerous enemy that can end your life at the smallest mistake). The best way to fully enjoy the experience is with the grounded difficulty imo: it is very challenging and you really get the feeling that you are trying to survive every danger of this world.,,I played the game a few times without ever getting tired of it, and the most emotional scenes never got any less intense. So yeah, this is one of my personnal favorites and it will probably stay that way for a very long time.;normal;English;10

JeyDee;This game is definitely the biggest surprise I have ever played. The graphics on that year are just gorgeous. The detail planted in the world can be seen everywhere. By the gameplay side, people say that it is good but I think it is perfect. You can not expect more from survival game where you play as a character that is not a hero but just a simple guy. And I think that is the beauty of this game and story. You play as a Joel who is not like some superhero. He does not do anything good and bad at all just what he think is best and it show you that you can not always be a good guy because there is no such a person. This game hits you on your hearth and you will definitely play this more than once. Especially know that you know how to approach the game you can try hardest dificulty, The Grounded mode which is incredibly hard but instead of having bulletsponge on enemies or just other discusting thinks that other games do to harden your experience this game gives you less resources, you can be killed on two shots and you have no sonar. Just like in real life. And that is how you build a game around being so real that you just feel every inch, every breath, every word, every shot, every kill, every emotions. There is a reason why this game has so many copies sold. 10/10;normal;English;10

Xitsa;"On my top 3 games of all time, top notch story telling and remarkable characters that develop in ways no other game does.,,""See, there was a sequel... wasn't as good"" - Joel Miller in TLOU Part II";expanded;English;10
DouchebagUncle;"I wasn't really interested in The Last of Us when it was released -I had never played a Naughty Dog game at the time- but I gave it a try and became my favorite PS3 exclusive. I played both the PS3 and PS4 versions but the latter is clearly superior with its glorious 1080p and 60 FPS and all DLCs included.,,I was invested in the story and Joel since the very beginning of the game and I really like both him and Ellie as characters. He is probably my favorite protagonist from any PlayStation exclusive. The narrative can be based on a cliche but the way Joel's father-daughter relationship with Ellie improves throughout the story is great. The cast is outstanding and at first I didn't even notice that Nolan North was in this.,,The gameplay is very good and I like the action or stealth approaches, the weapons and character upgrades and the real-time crafting system. I don't consider it a full survival horror game but some encounters can get really tense, specially on higher difficulties. The scarcity of ammo and resources on survivor or grounded mode forces you to approach most encounters with stealth and it's quite satisfying to choke every enemy one by one. However, shooting everybody with fully-upgraded weapons on NG+ is really fun. I noticed that some sections are so heavily scripted that you can sneak through everyone without killing them. The replayability is great thanks to the upgrades and the New Game+ and I ended up having nine playthroughs.,,It's a linear game but the scenarios in general are bigger than the ones in the first three Uncharted titles and encourages exploration to loot resources and ammo. I like reading some of the notes left by other survivors, particularly the story about Ish in the sewers.,,The visuals are amazing and it's one of the most realistic-looking games on PS3. Most scenarios are marvelous and the character models, lightning, attention to detail and motion capture are excellent. The tense atmosphere of the encounters with infected is well done, specially the ones at the University and the Underground Tunnel. The soundtrack is also amazing and it's easily one of the best on the console. I also like the fact that the Cordyceps infection is actually based on a real fungus that affects insects. The regular infected are generic but the creepy and unique clickers stole the show.,,The game's major flaw is by far the human enemies' A.I., which is really dumb. The infected are fine but the humans are beyond stupid. They seem to have a reduced field of view and won't hear when somebody is being choked to death behind them. Your companion can be loud and run right into the enemies and they won't react, but that would have made the game a lot harder. Also, the ""puzzles"" are way too easy and repetitive.,,I don't tend to play multiplayer modes but this one was surprisingly good. It's not purely focused on shooting like crazy and the matches consist of being stealthy and looting resources in order to craft items, buy upgrades and keep your clan healthy. I really enjoyed it and played way more than I could have expected. However, sometimes the matchmaking isn't fair and you end up against experienced players.,,The Left Behind DLC is okay but it's too short and one third of its duration are cutscenes. The sections in which you can force encounters between human enemies and infected are the best part of the DLC and is something that the base game should have had. It's not worth $10 on PS Store.,,The Last of Us is my favorite PS3 exclusive and was the best way to say goodbye to the console before the release of the PlayStation 4. So far, it has the best narrative in any Naughty Dog game, the graphics are top notch and the gameplay is great. I highly recommend it, preferably on PS4.";normal;English;9

srinu634;The last of us is okay. It's not too great and I don't feel this can be one of the best games ever made. Most of the missions were repetitive with stealth kills and the range of weapons was quite limited. The graphics were good but not great. The combat system is pretty limited too and there isn't a lot for crafting. The relational development Joel and Ellie was good but I didn't find it so emotional as a lot of other users might have found. Overall, I truly feel it's way over hyped and there are so many games better than this game in terms of graphics, combat system, loot, crafting etc.;normal;English;7

Great story in practice, but the game play is overall lacking. But the story covers most of the cracks and honestly, its good enough. The dialogue alone is worth playing this game.;expanded;English;9
Yurtser;A pleasant adventure that resembles a lighter version of the movie The Road. The relationship between Ellie and Joel is very well shown and their gradual strengthening of the relationship between each other is felt. The gameplay is very interesting, but the study of locations could be much better implemented. As for me, there is not enough of the oppressive atmosphere that is usually inherent in this genre. But for the interesting characters and the basic idea of a road adventure in the circle of the green zombie apocalypse, I can only thank Naughty Dog. The finale leaves with lumps in my throat and I really liked that I, as a player, were not given a choice at this moment, it should have been Joel’s decision, I’m just an outside observer.;normal;English;8
skoki_;A good game with an interesting story and a good atmosphere. The problem, however, is that the gameplay is very repetitive. You are in the underground, you fight zombies, the door is locked, you have to find something to open it while avoiding zombies.Over and over again.;expanded;English;7
Skurttish;We’ll start with the positives: I loved the gameplay, except that your crosshairs do an Irish jig every time you try to aim. Except for the dancing crosshairs, the gameplay was very entertaining and addictive. I would find myself planning out how to do the next level as I was going through my day after a session.,,The graphics are also great, really pretty game.,,The music was not the best, in my view, but if I want good music I’ll buy an album. Specifically, I didn’t like their reliance on synthesizers that sounded like they came from the late 80’s. I didn’t think that mood paired well with the mellow electric guitar, which I really liked. But, again, if I want music, I don’t buy a video game—my opinion of the game’s music did not affect the score I’m giving the game.,,Now for the negatives (or, really, negative, because I really see only one). The story was dark, depressing, and without any redeeming value. I had hoped for some sort of lightness somewhere, anywhere, but I was disappointed. Playing this game after a hard day at work was like working a double shift, because I had to put my mind on so many sad things at the end of a long day. (For this reason, I finished the game and watched a movie of the DLC, simply because I didn’t want to put myself through any more of the same discomfort.),,It was entertaining from a superficial standpoint, but any thought of what the story means or any deep analysis of the story’s characters can only lead to man’s depravity, I think. I prefer to focus on happier things. This game has taught me that this genre is not my genre, and though I bought this game with the expectation of also playing TLOU 2, I will not be buying the sequel.;normal;English;7
wesker2012;I tried playing the Last of Us at least 3 times and every time I just got bored of it and didn't feel compelled to keep playing.  The game mechanics and inventory system felt clunky and not intuitive.  The graphics were decent.  The AI seemed average.  I cant believe this game was rated 10's by so many people.  Only reason why is it seems it's living off the reputation of Naughty Dog and the cinematic experience of the game.  As much as I love cinematic games, if the gameplay isn't there, it feels lackluster as a game.  I just couldn't love this game the way others did.;normal;English;6

algal12;Originally this game that Naughty Dog managed to create is one of the most exciting, emotional, spectacular games I've ever played. I don't know where to start. For the first time I tried it on the PS4, from the first playthrough I recognized the value and dedication it took to create this masterpiece.,First of all, the story. From the beginning to the end of your playthrough in the fantastic and hard world of The Last Of Us, you are called to handle a character that wins you over in the first half hour, makes you feel compassion and sadness. You bond so much that you place it as something more than just a simple character in a game! This magical journey that follows, your contact with NPCs, either allies or foes, gives you a different look at the people in that society and forms a new mentality with the actions and events that await you. Great importance is given to the father and daughter relationship (?) And moves a large percentage of players. By the end of the game, the emotional contact that will cause you is almost certain. A story of love and decisions that one would sow even for the risk of all humanity. Clearly 10/10,Then the graphics, in the world the company has given great attention to detail and it's as if nothing escaped them! For that time, the graphics were fantastic, and even now that I'm going through it again, I'm still shocked! Awesome cinematics and moments when you just leave the controller and sit with your mouth open looking at the screen. 10/10,Music, It is obvious that the composers experimented and produced a wonderful result that leaves pieces that give you a sense of exactly what is needed to accompany the story and each controversy. Even the home screen won me over so much that I just opened the game just to listen to the soundtrack while studying. 10/10,Gameplay. The game is enriched with many features in your character and with various options with which you can deal with any situation. It gives a very strong inventory and many creative ideas for new items that will take the combat to another level. However, it can be a bit complicated and difficult to handle. Sometimes there are repetitive movements and animations and friendly AI is as if it doesn't exist, other times you pass the enemy in front of your eyes and remain unnoticed. However, for me, these did not spoil the experience I had in the game 9/10,Apart from that, it is very likely that you will want to play the game again and again, whether it is for platinum or just to relive the experience (I finished it 7 times!). I would suggest pursuing Grounded (more difficult level) which is a very good challenge for the more experienced! It also has a very nice simple multiplayer that you split into three game modes which kept me going for hours with my friends being killed nonstop !,In summary, every PlayStation 4 (3) owner is required (if possible) to acquire and complete this flawless work of art. A story that will stay in your mind, characters that will make you feel compassion and deep love, graphics and cinematics that take your breath away! The best game I've ever played! Clearly 10/10! Masterpiece!;normal;English;10
NikolayOss;"One of the best linear story-driven games of all time there is.,Played several times (original and remastered) and it clicks each time.,I don't really huge fan of the ending (I'm not a father and can't 100% imagine or feel this) but it's a really good quality written story with a logical end.,I highly recommend this game.,That's a pity we won't see a real sequel of this story ever, except the two (""Left Behind"" and ""The Birthday Gift"") DLC's.";normal;English;10
lemon1921;I love this game.  Yeah, sometimes the fighting or some missions can be a tad bit tedious. But the fantastic story and bond between Ellie and Joel really make up for it.  This game came out during the biggest fad of zombie media and I almost didn't get it because I was so over the zombie fad... but I'm so glad I did.  This is a really interesting take on zombies - spore zombies - that really raises the emotional and danger stakes of the game.  Joel's growth as a character is fantastic throughout the game, and Ellie is a very realiable sidekick.  This is a game I'll play over and over.

Dr_Unk;I'll admit, I tried to avoid this game for so long, Mainly because I'm not the biggest fan of zombie genre games.  But hearing nothing but good reviews, I had to play the game and I'm glad I did!  Looking for crafting items got a little  boring at times but that's a minor inconvenience to the rest of the game;expanded;English;9
SouthMouth;What an absolutely amazing story-based game. You quickly fall in love with Ellie and Joel the second they start their journey. The graphics are beautiful as well with an amazingly detailed environment. Only problem I had was with the game play having puzzles that were very repetitive, with there only being about 4 of the same puzzles in the game that involve a wooden board, ladder, dumpster, and planks. Other then that, amazing game. Would recommend for anyone looking to get their hands on something for the PS4.;normal;English;9

Lorenzo4421;One of the best games ever made, a masterpiece and a must-play for everyone. Naughtydog has always been famous for their spectacular games, especially regarding the graphics and the storytelling but with this title they exceeded even themselves and their previous games, making THE defining title of this generation. The gameplay is fun, tense when needed, the story is emotional and it really makes you fall in love with this fictional universe and the charachters in it. Wish I could give a higher score than 10.;normal;English;10

GunterTojo;I'm here to pay my respects after the abomination that was The Last of Us Part II. I played this game back in 2016 and I was thoroughly enraptured. The story was gripping, the characters were well developed, the gameplay was tense and satisfying, the graphics were great, the music was somber. It was an absolute package. Overall, the story was relatively simple, but it was executed masterfully which resulted in its message being incredibly impactful. It was a game about survival and parenthood. It's theme is that parents are willing to do anything to protect their children. Even sacrifice the world. Honestly, this game and its legacy is sullied by its sequel, but I'd still certainly recommend playing it today. Especially since you can buy it for a measly $20.;normal;English;8
jgmj921;Review after playing the sequel: Best-in-class story, made Ellie and Joel a classic duo in gaming history. Nevertheless some plots seemed pushed and not naturally reasonable enough. Gameplay is overall good, a bit repetitive at the end and 2 people taking out so many others really seems bit too much to me.;expanded;English;8
Adamsfamily943;I played this game on ps 3 at first,then it was free with ps+ on ps4.On Ps 3 I didn't finish the game and I thought I give it another chance.Honestly,I can't understand the hype around this game.I am not saying it's bad,but good doesn't start here.The gameplay was mostly boring for me.The shooting part is basically a pile of crap.The guns have an over exaggerated recoil,yet you can't see the result on the enemies.;normal;English;5
ManVil81;This is the prologue to an epic failure! Since the DLC, justifying someones orientation, this became a propagandistic panflet in favour of hatre and misandrics.

This game feels alive.  I cried when Joel cried. I feel sad when Ellie feels sad too. Most games are not like that. If someone ask me ''what makes it special for you?'' I can say absolutely the story and characters. I know Joel, I know Ellie and also I know you Bill who gives us the car and I hate you too.,,A masterpiece even after 20 years;normal;English;9

LizzieRusso;My actual favourite game of all time. I may be a bit biased though, since I played this when I was a newbie to games and loved it then. But since then the love for it has stuck with me. Can't express how amazing every single thing about this game is.,The soundtrack is beautiful and at times heart wrenching.,The zombies aren't just mindless hordes out to kill you and are actually scary.,The plot of the game is pretty straightforward but so well done it leaves a mark on you.,Most of all, the characters which are what really made this game for me. Tess, Bill, Marlene all of them had motivations that made their character arcs sensible and them as characters feel like real ppl. And the crown jewel of the game, Joel and Ellie and their amazing relationship that we get to see progress from distant travellers to a father - daughter dynamic to the point where Joel kills almost an entire hospital full of Fireflies to save Ellie. The ending is such a well done gray the choice that doesn't end up feeling dis satisfactory which many art forms struggle with.;normal;English;10

Joel has a great arc where he transitions from a rough grey character to a loving surrogate father. Ellie is a great supporting character and does a great job of making you either immediatly or slowly over the course of the game grow to love her.,The game leaves with a thought provoking ending and will have you thinking about it long after the story is done.;normal;English;9

VictorETD;TLOU is memorable. I know it's not perfect, but narrative and characters are soo good. Everything in this game has a good and intelligent writing. For the time the game was released his graphics were beautiful and even today they are really good. This remaster adds great features like 60 frames per second, photo mode and higher resolution quality, DLC is also included. My only critic point is - the gameplay deserved a little bit more freedom in the moments of exploration.;normal;English;9

JFeixasNix;By no means a masterpiece or excellent. Just a good game, nothing more. Very overhyped.,If you played lots and lots of great games you would realise this is nothing special at all. Lots of things can be improved, starting with the character movement and control, which is lackuster. The AI of the enemies is downright awful, and lots of programming errors. The melee combat is terrible, lacks basic things like parry and counter, which is non-existent. Once the enemy gets near enough to you, it grabs you and you can do absolutely nothing, which is very frustrating and very fake.,Some weapons are under-powered (guns) that you need 4 shoots sometimes to kill enemies and some are overpowered (bow) which can kill enemies in one shoot. I mean, really?,The story is also nowhere near as being as good as some claim. it lacks a lot of depth and has a lot of incongruences.,A very good idea of a game that has some good parts, but overall could have been better executed.,I'd take Uncharted 2 from ND over this any day of the week.;normal;English;6

andy24king24;I’ve been in and out of this game over the last couple of years but now on the eve of The Last Of Us 2 being released I’m playing catch up. This game has a way of sucking you in and keeping you guessing for more. It’s got a lot of heart, attention to detail and the graphics ok they aren’t perfect being a remaster but they are damn near good enough for a PS3 exclusive coming to PS4. I won’t say much more suffice to say, you’ll fall in love with the characters before long and the entire way the game moves along slowly but beautifully. I’ve not completed it but I have watched a story recap of this outstanding game so I’m kind of up to date with tomorrow’s release. And this I’ll say, it’s the greatest game ever made. But now the sequel is coming, that will become the greatest game ever made.;normal;English;10

nolioli;Dude the gameplay and graphics are typical and nothing new of Naughty Dog polish, but the most INTEGRAL part of TLOU1 was the gripping and touching story. TLOU2 had a messy, silly and quite frankly convoluted story with countless flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks.,,I can't count how many times the game should have ended. I was so tired of the screen going black and then seeing hulk hogan still standing there in 3rd person. Let me play as ELLIE the character I have bonded with. No matter what kind of sob story you throw at me for Abby I will NEVER forgive her for clubbing JOEL. JOEL THE MOST BADASS MAN TO LIVE. She came out of nowhere and took a fat dump on the storytelling legacy that is TLOU.,,To all those praising the gameplay, it's typical naughtydog gameplay, truly nothing was really changed. The graphics, yes it's stunning, omg the hair moves like real life!!! THE LEAVES MOVE 10/10 GAME!!!!! it's gorgeous blah blah blah but the writing is horrendous and feels like Neil Druckman's WattPad fanfic. TLOU1 made me cry 3 seperate times. So did TLOU2 after the 11th ending, i was sobbing wanting to be freed from the convoluted time loop story telling.,,No sequel was ever needed.;normal;English;3

I personally don’t see what’s so special about it but that’s just my personal view. I didn’t enjoy the gameplay (I’m not an apocalyptic genre fan) or the world it was set.

Potatoes953;Truly an amazing experience that was one of the reasons that I bought a PlayStation 4 along with Persona 5. The game is great with solid game-play mechanics, beautiful visuals, well made set pieces and amazing writing. The characters are grounded and relatable without Joel, the main character being just some generic dude with a gun.  The game is one massive escort mission but the fact that it is one isn't even noticed by the player as it doesn't feel like one, Ellie is useful and doesn't actually do anything harmful to the player like in Resident Evil 4.,There is some amazing visual storytelling much like Bioshock but unlike Bioshock all of it must be found by the player through notes and audio diaries that are found in totally out there locations. Bioshock has that kind of thing only it is far harder for the player to miss those audio logs as they glow and whatnot. Furthermore, the Last of Us has crafting mechanics using everyday items found throughout the post-apocalyptic US landscape. The game's story also never gets boring, it is perfectly paced so that the player never gets bored by the plot or game-play which is something other PlayStation exclusives cannot say. Overall the game is fantastic and a definite must play but if you don't have a PS3 or PS4 there are many great lets-plays out there on YouTube.  There is a lot Naughty Dog must live up to for the second game so here's hoping they can match it or exceed it in quality.;normal;English;10
Barnes_Jake;One of the best stories you will ever see in a video game.  Hands down one of my favorite games of all time.  The gameplay is great too.  It's the perfect mix of fun and challenging.  It is not only great within the survival horror genre, but in gaming as a whole.;expanded;English;10

Alentejano;Certainly the best take on the zombie apocalypse, at least the most human take. It starts incredibly, welcoming you to its world and characters by showing realistic and also entertaining relatioships between certain characters(mostly the father-daughter ones). The beginning is emotional and the rest of the game is as good, putting in a lot of effort in creating human characters with flaws(like Joel) and in developing the Joel's relatioship with Ellie. The storytelling is great, the direction of the whole game and its cutscenes are amazing, the performances are among the best in video-games, movies and TV, it has some of the most tense scenes I've had to play through (the ones where you have to get past Clickers and Runners without being noticed) and the music fits perfectly with the game's environment. This is indeed a Masterpiece.;normal;English;10

Wulfy;Played this recently and wow it's incredible! The Last Of Us is an absolute masterpiece and developer Naughty Dog got this game perfect. Throughout my entire 18 hour playthrough, not once did I come across a bug or a mechanic I didn't like. And oh my lord the story is straight up THE best of this decade. Next to LiS Season 1 and LiS BtS. Those games are very close to me and TLOU just made the first spot, with the other two coming second and third. Its structure and gameplay ties the narrative into a beautifully built world with high levels of detail, perfect sound design and lighting. The Remaster takes the original game, and enhances it for PS4. Making the framerate cap a solid 60FPS and 1080p+ resolutions. The motion capture in this game is perfect, with an excellent cast of actors and actresses, including Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson. This game really hits the spot for narrative loving gamers, and the inclusion of the LEFT BEHIND DLC adds more backstory and gives even more clarity to the characters. I can't say this enough, PLAY THIS GAME WHENEVER YOU CAN.;normal;English;10

GamingNation2K;One of the best video games every released. The Last of Us is still relevant today and used as a measuring stock and an example for what other games of a similar genre can learn from. Top-notch storytelling, gameplay and music. Naughty Dog created a masterpiece. It's an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. Everyone should experience this game! Despite all the negativity its sequel is receiving at the moment, I'm just as excited for it as I was when ND first announced it almost four years ago! I can't wait;normal;English;10

Guppy13-14;Loved this game one of the only games I could say made me have a emotional attachment to the characters. The one scene with Ellie and Joel discussing Loss after she ran away always bring droplets to my eyes. The game has a way of building and staying true to the characters. Joel is a wonderful character that grows through the game with his connection with other characters. The decision that he makes at the end of the game u feel the hardship of doing it as your forced to kill but you feel why he did it as you see what had him make these choices through his journey. Ellie amazing as she goes through the struggle of growing up through the apocalyptic world wondering how the world used to be. Through the game you see the bad of the world but u also get a sense of hope as these character discuss how Joel might teach Ellie how to play the guitar and how he was when he young. The best part of the game is the characters, of you like a story told through characters this is a must play.;normal;English;10

rcoberle54;I played this again right when quarantine kicked off. It felt like the appropriate time to do so. Everything about this game is brilliant. The cinematics, the story, the action, the gun play, the stealth. Everything works so damn well. My only grip is that I found one minor technical issue with the walking. A lot of people online were saying that it's the controller that does that, but I've had no similar issue with any other game and I read that a lot of ppl experienced the same thing. I would rate this as a 9.5 out of 10 just for that because 9 feels too low for this game. It didn't detract enough from the game and I probably even enjoyed this playthrough more than the original one when it first came out. I just couldn't say enough good things about this game. Is part 2 here yet?;normal;English;10
Shimmeywill;Purely subjective review and is just here for personal record. This game is fantastically produced and has some A-list acting. However, the stealth/survival gameplay and heavy emphasis on a cinematic story simply did not click with me. the cutscenes try really hard to make you care and I while they are not bad, they just don't do it for me. Not a bad game, review is just of personal enjoyment.;expanded;English;3
TonyJunior;The Last Of Us is a greatest game in many aspects, because the gameplay is complete, the graphics are excellent, for a game originally released in 2013 and remastered in 2014, the cadence is great, the story is perfect and exquisitely told, the soundtrack is excellent and it is present in the necessary moments in order to amplify the immersion and the emotion, besides that, the artistc diretion is very good, the variation of scenarios and the beauty with which they are created is excellent. For this reasons I really recomend play this game, because is a true masterpiece in the games world.;normal;English;10

Cafe_8bits;TLOU remembers me what i like the most in a video game, but not because it is good on doing it, but because it refuses to do so. If you check my top rated games, all of them have something in common with each other: They do things in a way only video games can lead to, they narratives and mechanics can only work if on a video game.,TLOU sadly is not one of them, its narrative is shallow and can work in a multitude of other medias. Not to say its a bad game, because it certainly its not a bad game, but it absolutely is not a masterpiece, even tho its a good and polished game, with great characters.;normal;English;6
Filmanwalt;What an excellent narrative between two Characters in an apocalyptic scenario.,,Story,,The Story about the trip of Joel and Ellie is stunning. Its simply amazing and dont really have weak spots in it. Its linear but very well written about the two and all things around them.  Both  characters will catch your heart and you will care for them, especially Ellie.,,It has an open End so Part 2 cant come soon enough, good that I finished the Game now and not earlier. Im very interested to see what is coming next for both.,,Graphics,,For an old Game like this it looks in the remaster version really good. Some moments are pure beauty. The People look mostly insanly realistic. And the postapocalypse is perfect portraied.,,Gameplay,,It has his flaws here. The stealth mechanics arent mine but I was fine with it. The AI is really bad and can get you out of the imersion. Sometimes Ellie will run trough enemies or runs wildly around the room.,,The AI of the opponents are mostly good, but there are Ways to cheese it or they just doesnt recognize that you kill their friend besides them. The Crafting or skilling is very shortened but doesnt matter that much, the most important things like Medkits are there.,,The Gunplay feels a bit sluggish but all in all it was good enough.,,Summary,,If u didnt play this game already like me DO IT. Its an insane good story. 9/10;normal;English;9

And in Joel, something human again awakens after a time spent with Ellie. And at the end of the game, Ellie becomes for Joel a personal salvation from this world. Therefore, he did not allow cicadas to create a vaccine from it to help humanity.

syandicate;#?;expanded;English;10
psylife;"The first thing to note is that the game is surprinsingly short (Hard playthrough) - The absence of uniquely crafted set pieces points towards the fact that the game might have had a lower budget than previous naughty dog productions. Gameplay wise, you are looking at a competent stealth action game, but that does nothing new to advance the genre.,,Let's be clear, as far as stealth options are concerned, you get to chose between throwing a brick, or a bottle, that's it. There are no exciting environmental opportunities to leverage, no interesting situational obstacles to deal with, and boredom sets in as, you deal with fairly identical situations, over, and over. Think of Uncharted, with extra boring interruptions, walking sections, and with the fun action bits removed. They also got rid of the puzzles too since you now get to play with bricks and ladders.,,The crafting and looting is competently handled, but there is really nothing in terms of gadgets or skill tree worth praising above and beyond the competition.,,And that's my problem, in the light of all of these observations, it is difficult for me to accept the praise the game has garnered. Maybe an exceptional scenario and plot could have justified the praises, but considering how cliche and predictable the story is, it is that much more difficult to reconcile myself with its critical success.,,Yes, the acting, music, presentation and production value is a cut above the competition, but as far as 2013 release games, I can think of so many games that easily outclass The last of us in terms of game and level design, pacing, mechanics, and player agency. Games such as Tomb raider, Blacklist, GTAV, not only do more, but they do it better - and if we wanted to draw a comparison with a game that more closely resembles the last of us, Spec ops: The line is the more successful of the two in realizing both its game-play and story-telling ambitions.,,The last of us remains a moderately enjoyable game, it does have a few saving graces in terms of scenario and game-play (like the hunting sandbox at the beginning of the winter chapter), but it is far too repetitive and limited in scope to be considered anything above the best the competition has to offer. It is also worth noting that 2 of Resident evil 4's most memorable, fun, and iconic game-play moments were ""borrowed"" by Naughty dog, though not as well executed as in Capcom's masterwork.,,As a videogame, The last of us only truly excels at mimicking what has previously been done better on film and TV, yet does very little in terms of intelligent design, and interactive story telling.";normal;English;6

Potatoman22;Absolute masterpiece 10/10 my all time favourite game I’m not exactly a fan of horror video games but I still absolutely love this game and can’t wait for the sequel. The story is amazing, the characters feel so real, and I love the soundtrack. The game is so immersive remember the part where Joel gets separated from Ellie and has to find a key card to unlock a door by turning in a generator and it alerts a bunch of zombies I got so immersed in that part I actually had to use the washroom after because of how scared I got or how sometimes I would get worried when I was low on ammo and had to use creative stealth strategies since I suck at being stealthy In games. Another reason I love this game is because of the characters and how they show real emotions and get closer as the story progresses. That’s another thing I like it’s a mainly story based game I’m not a fan of backtracking and it’s why I don’t really like side missions with some games I’m fine with them but others I just don’t like it. Overall even if you don’t like the horror genre definitely play this game.;normal;English;10

Many years.. and I still return to this world with great joy. Again experiencing those same emotions after the first pass. And it's not worth saying how much I'm waiting for The Last of Us Part 2.

Maugaran;I can't understand the hype about this game. I have played 3-4h of the game and it has inspired me zero. The story resembles a romance novel for little girls. Emotions equal zero.

death12123;Such a good game but it's ruined by it's controls. One thing is that the story is top tier. It's one of the best I've ever played. Gameplay is good and I understand the feel. Some things could've been better but the thing that kills it for me is the sensitivity. I maxed out the sensitivity and it's STILL unbearably slow. Keep in mind on PC I play at 3200 DPI and on games like COD on console at Insane setting. For story node the slow sensitivity is fine but for Online it's unplayable. I mean you have enemies coming from the back and you turn as slow as the hour moves on the clock. If it wasn't for this I'd easily give this game a 10. Story and the game are beautiful nontheless. Online and the sensitivity on the other hand? Not good at all. That's one problem with consoles though. As much as I love it, if the settings only allow a certain thing, that's all you get. If anything they should allow custom settings to your hearts content on TLOU2 or atleast way higher sensitivity than what feels like a 4 out of 10 on other games.;normal;English;9
PanMrkvicka;Pretty overrated game but still a quality game with even though not interesting zombie setting but very great storytelling which makes the setting actually good and some of the characters but its till pretty predictable.

Xemnuz;I cannot understand how this game became GOTY. It's a good game, or at least decent. Graphics, sounds, narrative, customization etc is quite good, but it has so much potential wasted. And why make a grumpy main character? Finding a pallet for Ellie about 5 times is pretty repetetive. To see Metro Last Light and Black Flag not winning over this is pretty sad, even Bioshock Infinite, but I think this game appeals to the casual gamer and most women for some weird reason..;normal;English;6
stratogustav;"This game was trash for me, pure garbage. It is an extremely poorly implemented Resident Evil 4 clone, with boring stealth gameplay, that tried to separate itself of that by adding ""TV show / soap opera"" elements to the overall package, and gave us a very uninspired experience as a result, that even better graphics can't save it. I would give the game a 5, but because it is a game that I actually hate for all the terrible repercussions that it inflicted on the industry, I have to give it the lowest score.";normal;English;0
ragerino;I had a great time playing this game. The story is immersive. Gameplay is great. Difficulty is adjustable. And it's possible to set graphics to 1080p/30FPS so my PS4 Pro doesn't sound like a jet engine at take off.;expanded;English;10
JesterTRT;The Single player is solid. It has a good story, decent game play. However, for trophy hunters, the amount of collectibles is a bit painful. Pendants, comics, optional conversation, joke conversations. Then gears for gun upgrades, plants for skill upgrades. I'm not big on collectibles. However, the story makes it a good game.,,However, the multiplayer is horrible. If it wasn't for trophies, and trying to hunt the platinum, this mode in not even worth looking at. It doesn't belong in this type of game, at all. It was broken and horrible.,This multiplayer mode is the main reason it was dropped down a few points.;normal;English;7

Wolfenstein11;everything about this game chills me , characters are one of the finest work that naughty dog created also the same could be said about the world,a story that strikes hard and sometimes fills your eyes with tears and the other makes u smile,from a gamplay perspective it delvers a great job for making u blend in well with what is happening around u,soundtrack did its job too with memorable cuts;expanded;English;10
Goodreviewer69;Im in like half of the playthrough and the story is pretty overrated, not amazing, not bad, pretty okay. The world is probably the strongest pros about this game. Very good looking locations, enviroments and all. I believed that this is how apocalpytic world could look like. Now for the biggest con of this game for me and why i gave it only 1/10. The combat and hardest difficulty (which i played on). First of all its **** insane how many bugs are in this game mostly in combat, how the game manages to bug itself so many times in such a different ways its beyond me that this is triple A game and even REMASTERED one. The game has no potential to be that hard like on the hardest diff. They just put it here for fun. The character u are moving is ultra clunky. The enemies dont even need to hit u. If u are too close to the enemy and he ends his attacking animation and doesnt hit u, dying animation still starts and u just die. The mob didnt had to hit u u just had to be in some **** magical area around this mob while he ends his attacking animation and thats it. U ARE DEAD. 0 precision. 0 potential for this game to be that hard. If u cant make game with fair combat that is polished in some basic level then dont put this hard diff into the game. Another thing is that in some areas zombies are just stupid **** mobs. In some areas they are hiding from u and runninng away from u like they had an AI upgrade while i wasnt watching. Also another thing is that in the first 3 hours of the game there are no zombies in the game at all. After this time they just magically spawn to chase u for like 3 hours and then they magically disaper to be replaced by those bandits. How is there so many **** bandits anyway. One of them literally said that whole group caught 5 people of potential food and supplies in 1 week. And there is like 100 of them. How the **** are they not starving to death. Ultra stupid **** They had to fill this garbo game with something so they copied 20 combat events changed 5 lines of text and changed enviroment in some of them. SUPER FUN.,Graphics: 8/10,Story: 5/10 (based on 10 hours of gameplay or so),Music -,World: 9/10,Combat (which is like 90% of the game): 3/10,Difficulty management: 0/10 (hardest diff shouldn't even exist),Many logical problems and combat bugs;normal;English;1

weskergamer;SO my problem with this game is that after playing the Uncharted series, this game feels like a step back for Naugthy Dog. It is slow af, the story is borring and cliche, Uncharted 3 had better graphics and phisics even though U3 is 3 years older. Being a Naugthy Dog fan since the beginning, this game is very disappointing. And to people saying this is the game of the generation, they should play other games really.;normal;English;4

JayNxtGen;The Last of US is a superb Video Game/Movie game with great voice acting and a interesting story that you will enjoy from start to finish but personally I found the gameplay a fair bit dull and clumsy (could be on purpose) with the aiming being really shaky and movement a little odd but that will not distract you from the story being told here. If you are a Single Player type of gamer this is perfect for you. Multiplayer is honestly so so...;normal;English;8
HomoLudens;Went through it when it was free on PSN. The motions are great and I have no doubt that with proper operation it would look it a Hollywood movie.,,When I came to it I've heard a lot about its wonderful plot. It did have some good moments, but the overall gameplay was filled with repetitive zombie killing and stealth. It is mostly annoyed when you try to stealth a clicker. The combats are tiring but without much fun, just the same well polished prototype (even not that well) all along the game. It really upset me that I have to be interrupted by such dull fights when enjoying the story.;normal;English;7

Jam0_;This is one the of the greatest games ever created. I played and finished this game three times. This story rich third-person shooter has some of the best gameplay, graphics, sound and lighting I have ever seen in any video game. The story captivates the player and does what every good writer attempts to do get the player to have a vested interest in the characters and their world. Not only is the story written extremely well but the gameplay is crafted in a way that everyone can enjoy. It's intense and has just enough gore to keep anyone involved in the action. The action also isn't overly unnecessary and is used carefully throughout the game even though it is one of the main components. The lighting and sound design are used in such a way that intense moments are truly intense and scary moments did make me scared. Most importantly moments of hate, love and laughter were also crafted perfectly. However, this game lacks in multiplayer. Bare in mind I went into this game with the sole purpose of playing the story so I wasn't that bothered by the multiplayer. The multiplayer while challenging and creative it lacks fun. Leveling and unlocks, in my opinion, take way too long and the unchanged combat from the story can be tedious when playing online in a competitive setting. I hope to see more coop multiplayer options in The Last of Us 2.,,Overall this has got to be one of my favourite games of all time. I believe there is something to find for everyone in this game.;normal;English;9
MissDaisy;"I ""only"" give it eight points and here's why:,1. The tutorial is crazy long. Imo It should be: ""Here's the guns, there is the exit. Now go and try your best. If any questions pop up, press X for help."",2. It's unnecessary cruel. From innocent kids being shot to our hero-friends shooting someone in the head who regrets a mistake he has done in the past. Close-up, of course. You have to be sadistic to like that sort of thing. The only thing missing was a white floor so you can watch the bloodpool widen.,3. The tube you move in for the story. (like ""Uncharted""). If you like ""tube""-games, you will love this. If you would rather move around and be creative, this story will bore you, just like it bored me.,Apart from that: nice graphics, good gameplay. The core game is not bad at all.";normal;English;8
SHiiK3n;Finally finished the game after playing it in ps3 and day 1 ps4, the last of us shares the same gameplay of all other Sony exclusives so there's nothing special about the gameplay, enemies are probably 4 types throughout the whole game, unoriginal story and storytelling, characters especially the MC's are garbage.

PixelFist;The Last of us remastered is one the greatest video games every made in terms of gameplay, graphics, music and story.,The game tells a gripping tale of two people who don’t know each other and are strangers to each other. They are both trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world we’re an infected outbreak has gone loose. The game shows you how these two people are becoming closer together. The outbreak is also a more grounded take on a zombie out break, instead of just being zombies, they are now infected by a fungus type infection called the cordyceps. This game brings a lot of strategy to the standard bet em up/shooter genre. It brings in elements of survival gameplay with limited resources and ammo. This forces you to do stealth which is hard in its own way.,The music is very mellow but complements the story and gameplay. It was very well done by gustavo santaolalla.,The game is a refreshing spin on the zombie and post apocalyptic formula we have become so a costumed to today. The game shows us as people just how lucky we are to live in a organized society. There is no video game experience like it. Except the Last of Us Part 2;normal;English;10

MEMESAREPEOPLE;I initially thought The Last of Us was just another zombie game with a lackluster story and gameplay. That’s what the game wants you to think. Once I delved deeper into the game, it was unlike anything I have ever played. The story had a lot of emotional moments, and those truly felt real due to the perfect writing and voice acting. The emotional moments didn’t distract the fact that there is still a compelling story underneath it. The gameplay is demanding and difficult, and it won’t hold your hand, due to dwindling supplies, smart enemies, and a true sense of dread during every encounter, makes every combat scenario dynamic and fun. The crafting system is simple, but requires you to make tough decisions on the fly that will affect what the outcome of a different encounter might be. For example, should you craft a medkit, or a molotov? Should you craft a shiv, or a bomb? Not only does the remastered version have the full single player with 60 fps high quality graphics and lighting, but also contains a unique and fun multiplayer to boot. Not only that, the excellent DLC, Left Behind is included as well, providing a different story about Ellie, and providing a different perspective of the zombie infected world. The Last of Us was a true masterpiece on the PS3, and its done even better on the PS4. I cannot recommend this game enough.;normal;English;10

I cried, smiled, laughed, and connected with the characters in a way I have never done with any other game. Do yourself a favor and play this game.;normal;English;10
Colty250;There aren't many video games that deserve a perfect 10 and The Last Of Us by Naughty Dog is one of them. The story is one of the greatest ever told in gaming and will leave you desperate with questions and quenched with satisfaction. What is often left out in story heavy games is the game play but The Last of Us has no compromises, the intractable environments in melee combat are extremely well done and the animations for a game released last generation are almost unbeatable and are only beaten by the exact same developers in Uncharted 4. You can feel the connection Joel and Ellie develop throughout the game and are left dying with excitement to know what will happen to Ellie and Joel in Part 2.,,Played on PS4 (1920x1080 @ 60fps);normal;English;10
jelikey;Like it or not, The Last of Us is an undeniable masterpiece, despite some minor shortcomings in it's combat.,Its immersive story, incredible characters and heart wrenching writing made for one of, if not THE best PS3 game of all time... And now, it's undoubtably the PlayStation 4's best title, and will probably remain that for a long while.;expanded;English;10
WarkKnight;The graphics were amazing, they held up decently.  The gameplay is janky, fine-tuned, but I think the result was honestly below average gunplay and melee combat that uses its flaws to create the illusion of difficulty.  The animations are really good, but the realism just makes things more clunky than fun.  I think the story is up there with a lot of better direct-to-video movies, but video game oscar equivalent? No.  Overall I think it's a fine game, but not a magnum opus.;normal;English;6
BradMorgan;The last of us is a real masterpiece by Naughty Dog. Both the original version and the Remaster were fantastic.,The characters are unique and balanced. Gradually the relationships between the characters and their actions, emotions and actions change. This together with the good level design and the realistic 'clickers' made it an unforgettable experience. everything falls into place. A must (even now in 2019) for every PS4 owner!;normal;English;10

mishi631;The game cannot really be given a vote higher than 7 because it has 1 critical bug and several serious bugs, despite the updates/patches. The saving system is broken, with the autosave system overwriting the manual saves.

squalledu86;I give this a 10 out of 10. Even though I played it under not ideal circumstances.I was like in a sort of cryogeny for like 10 20 years without gaming and then all of a sudden I had the time and spare cash to buy games and a console. I got my PS4 around the time the Pro launched. I didn't know Naughty Dog. After hearing excellent things about Uncharted I got intoit. I played it on baby mode with auto-aim on. I had a blast. I saw TLOU on sale many times and all the buzz aabout it but I didn't get into it. After playing Uncharted 4, I learned TLOU was also from ND. I got excited and waited for a chance to play TLOU. Eventually I got that. So, I expected something like what I had with Uncharted 4 , like I would just sit back and enjoy the ride. And then I was like, what? I guess if English was my mother tongue I'd definitely say something like F---. The setting was so tense, people were evil and then there weree those monsters, they were just horrifying. Man, I couldn't expect that from ND, such a distinct game. I was confident it would be another cake walk like U4 but it wasn't. And before, I mainly played RPGs. So, I was bad really at aiming and in TLOU being a survival game your ammo is limited and it's harder to aim, because your arm swings. And then there were those creatures, those things. Man, my first encounter with a clicker, I just kept dying and dying, I was like F---. I'm very weak, and at that point I couldn't stand anything horror related, and after dying so many times to that clicker, I was just so scared that I couldn't fight it anymore so I just startred running around and eventually by running around I figured hoew to beat that level, not the bestest of solutions but it worked. I'd say that this was my tougest moment in the game, there are worse monsters through the game but I guess this is what people call learning curve. Yeah, those clickers are unlike anything I've ever seen. Normally I'd put down such a game for being too scary, but now being not so young anymoire I felt I couldn't put it down. That was great because after playing TLOU I feel that my life is now divided between Before TLOU and After TLOU. After TLOU is awesome, because now I can play horror games, in fact I've played 2 in a row: Prey and Alien Isolation. Never thought I'd get into these types of games. So, thank you very much ND! I'm excited for Parts II and III and ...,,I have to mention, that I think that on E3 before release they unveiled it and people knew it was a survival horror game, and people knew this would be big, and indeed it beacame.;normal;English;10

Hammerhead09;Being born in 1988 and having spent the better part of 20 years or so playing games I struggle to remember a game that induced so much emotion as this game did. The opening scene itself is a masterpiece on its own.,,The general pacing of the game and the gameplay itself are all excellent. If you own a PS4 Pro then you get to enjoy the added benefits of either better visuals or increased frame rate.

Lukeazade;Survival gameplay. (Crafting, limited supplies, stealth),Setting and world-building are both fantastic and very immersive.,Strong characters and voice acting.,Story and Storytelling are expertly done through many means but one of my favourites is the use of multiple playable characters at poignant moments to emphasise what the character is feeling and put the player in their shoes.,Technical masterpiece especially considering the hardware it released on.,The weapons feel great.,,Joel should move faster. His animations, on the whole, are a little slow and clunky feeling in the pursuit of realism. This is only a problem once you lose stealth and a fight breaks out. The feeling of having multiple enemies from different directions often feels overwhelming because of his slower movement in combat.,,AI companions can break immersion by not being detected when they move poorly and sometimes feel as if they get in the way but is counteracted by how awesome it feels when Ellie does genuinely help you out in a fight and it beats the alternative of having them get spotted by enemy AI when their pathing is bad. Something I hope improves if there are AI companions in The Last Of Us Part II is the AI's pathing when following the player. This would fix the minor immersion problem present here.;normal;English;10
Omalpha;What can I say about this game that hasn’t already been said? The graphics were phenomenal on the PS3 and they only look better on the PS4. The gameplay is fun and could very easily carry the game. The characters, especially Joel and Ellie are some of the deepest and richest that I have ever seen, with them both developing amazingly as the story progresses. With the side characters like Tess and Marlene also needing a mention.

bulger_paul;"I had been interested in checking out this game since it first came out, but I only got my first Playstation ever a few weeks ago, so I had no way to do so until recently, and, well, I'm a little disappointed.,,Don't get me wrong, the things people praise about this game are every bit as good as I'd heard, this game has excellent writing and voice acting, Ellie and Joel's relationship is edifying to watch unfold and to discuss, but there's just something that's ""missing"" in the link between storytelling and gameplay mechanics that's difficult for me to get over.,,When I say there's something ""missing,"" what I mean to say, is there's no connection between storytelling and gameplay at all. This game is like a Skinner box, but with a bunch of extra steps. You go through an area with some very light, often times tedious puzzle solving that usually boils down to ""find the thing and move the thing that lets you jump over the other thing,"" or ""find the thing that lets you open the thing,"" interspersed with a ton of moments comprised of ""kill every dude in the area who isn't you,"" before you're rewarded with another cutscene, and I can't count how many times I found myself disappointed the minute a cutscene ended and the gameplay began, because it meant another solid 30-60 minutes of trudging through not particularly great gameplay to get rewarded with another cutscene.,,That brings me to my second major issue with this game: the gameplay, on its own, really just isn't that good. As I mentioned earlier, it is almost entirely broken up into two kinds of sequences, 1) wandering around a small area to find the thing that let's you get past the obstacle, or 2) killing every dude on the map who isn't you, and that's it. It's interspersed with some exciting moments, like a moment where you're trying to push start a truck while finding off clickers, or a moment where you're defending Ellie from Clickers while she tries to free you from a trap that has you suspended upside-down, but these moments are few and far between gameplay that is, overall, bog standard, and does absolutely nothing to enhance the narrative through its mechanics, you simply just do a few objectives using mechanics that have little to with the narrative, so you can be rewarded with some new cutscenes, and that's about it. And all of that doesn't even get into the dozens of odd moments where the gameplay and story are completely at odds with each other in quite baffling ways. For example, there's a scene where a dude is on top of you trying to drown you, and then Ellie shoots him to save you, then later in the game, there's a moment where Joel is rationalizing her action to save you, telling her not to worry about the fact that she just killed a man, since it was either ""him or me [Joel],"" but it makes absolutely no sense that Joel would need to cauterize that one particular action in that one particular moment, considering the fact that Ellie has already helped you kill well over twenty people in the gameplay, which just reinforces the fact that the gameplay and story departments working on this game had little to no crossover with each other. The narrative tells you one story, about Ellie losing her innocence to a harsh, unforgiving world, but in the gameplay, there's no resistance or struggle or pushback at all to Joel killing scores and scores of nameless, faceless, storyless dudes all for the sake of advancing to the next cutscene.,,All and all, The Last of Us is a real shame, because the acting and writing are truly very good, but the narrative just gets put on hold during gameplay sequences that have barely have anything to do with the narrative, and do nothing at all to enhance the narrative, and I find it disappointing that what has been almost universally lauded as one of the greatest video games ever made has a story that does nothing to take advantage of the fact that it is an interactive medium and capable of telling you a story through mechanical interactions.,,I'm not going to call this game ""overrated"" because I do truly understand why this game emotionally resonated with so many people, but I'm still disappointed all the same and I really wish I had loved this game more than I did.";normal;English;6

Alsethe2nd;I never experienced the original The Last Of Us and couldn't resist buying it after all the praise it got from family, friends and online, It was definitely worth it. The Last Of Us has one of the most gripping narratives in any game I have ever played accompanied by its tight and quick gameplay and simplistic yet genius musical score all bundled up with the remastered graphics, which at times surprised me with the beauty at which a game released in 2014 could produce.,,The story can be summed up as, the main characters Joel and Ellie are sent out into a post pandemic world outside the safer quarantine zone (that's the best I can do without spoilers), the story has you falling in love with the characters and wishing to see there story through to the end. The whole thing is an emotional roller coaster that you don't want to get off of.,,Adding on, the gameplay makes you feel like a survivor (especially on higher difficulties), fighting humans for resources and just to live, avoiding zombies if at all possible, the HUD is all tightly connected and accessible making combat and crafting smooth and although the game is catered towards a stealth approach it is not very necessary if playing on difficulties lower than Survivor, which by the time you are playing on these difficulties you will already have been use to the mechanics of it anyway. Moreover, humanities desperate situation is again emphasised by its brilliant artistic design, which in the dark the cities evoke fear in the player and the need to survive, so much so that for the beginning of the game I found myself scared of dying, and at day the cities are beautiful almost showing some hope for humanity yet to be claimed.,,One of my favourite parts of the game is its amazing sound track, the music whilst simplistic sets all the necessary tones for each scene only adding to what is already amazing and not taking anything away. If you have somehow not played this game and found my review I urge you to play it (especially if you like story driven games) it feels you with so much emotion and fear and is an experience you really should not miss out on. (Plus the Remastered version comes with the DLC).;normal;English;10

Nagoyablue73;Brought this because of the hype, but I am disappointed.  Game play is incredibly linear.  It mainly consists of go here, kill everybody/all the monsters in the area, repeat.  The story/character,development so far has been the biggest disappointment, the story basically being the young girl may be the key to a cure, take her to someone who can help develop a cure.  That's not a plot we've seen in a thousand movies/games before, is it now? That's it.  Characters?  He's grumpy, she's mouthy.  That's about all you can say about them.,,It basically plays like a telltale walking dead game, but with less choice/character development/story, much better graphics and annoying combat sections.,,Also, why kill all the humans you meet, even the ones who never act aggressively  towards you until they catch you sneaking around, trying to kill them?  One group are in a hotel, clearing out monsters.  Are they good or bad?  Who knows, just wipe them out. Often, just sneaking through to the exit  isn't an option.,,I'll probably put it on easy and play to the end, but I'm not impressed so far.;normal;English;6

This game is amazing. The game play is the least appealing part of the game, i personally see it as a tool used to serve the story. I'm not saying the game play is bad, because it most defiantly is not. The story is just that good. The story is not the most original, the magic lies within the complex layering of emotion. This emotion is so very human and contrast throughout your journey by being surrounded in a mess of ex-humans turned monsters. This theme is foreshadowing throughout the journey while your characters struggle to keep what traits and beliefs that makes them human from being diluted by a cruel and savage world.,,Topping off the must buy review is the amazing voice acting that helps punch home the story.,,Go buy it now.;normal;English;9

superpyro296;This is obvioulsly a great game. I'm giving it a 8,5/10 rating. Expect a narrative game with amazing visuals. The story is good and emotional. If English is not your first language (like myself), I strongly recommend to use the subtitles in order to don't miss anything about the story (this game was not translated in French),,In terms of gameplay, I'm also satisfied. The game design is really similar to the Uncharted series (both games are made by Naughty Dog). There are a lot of checkpoints, so you don't have to start a level all over again. This compensates for the harder difficulty when you reach the last levels (winter and spring). I completed this game on Normal difficulty and I died a lot,,I totally understand all the amazing reviews this game got. Objectively, I believe it deserves 9/10 ratings. However, just because stealth games are not my cup of tea (don't mean I don't like this genre just that it's not my preference), I'm comfortable giving a 8/10 rating.,,Especially at the end of the game, you have to play stealthy in order to survive as your ammo is really limited and the enemies can absorb a lot of damage. This is where I struggled. However, this is an opportunity to develop other strategies which is fine.,,The story also left me a bit confused....,,In conclusion, I strongly recommend this game. This is an experience you won't forget (visuals, sound, animations are amazing and this is where this game shines most);normal;English;8

Cloud302;I've been a gamer for over two decades now (ever since the original Nintendo), and I can firmly and confidently say that this is THE best game I've ever played.,,This game without a doubt deserves 5/5. I feel that anyone that gives it less didn't get what it was trying to do. This isn't a standard video game. It's primary purpose is to tell you a story. An interactive story, where you actually feel like you're there with the characters, experiencing everything with them as they experience it. It's something books and movies can't quite pull off, and is video game specific. Even among games, it's extremely rare that a truly successful and well-done interactive narrative can be pulled off so successfully. Everything really matters.,,The only downside I can think of is that there is a ton of swearing, and a pretty decent amount of violence, so this game isn't for the little ones below 10 years. Also, the AI does odd stuff occasionally. But virtually everything else is virtually flawless, breath-taking, heart-breaking, and intense. The writing, art & environments, acting, and music are all above top-notch. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, whether it be due to wondering what's lurking around the corner, or to hear what interesting tid-bit your in-game companions will say next.,,I suppose, in the end, the reason why I love it so is simply because it explores the range and depth of human emotion.,,This game is for anyone and everyone that appreciates a good story. If you've ever enjoyed a fictional book, movie, or video game, in your entire life, you owe yourself this experience. Do what you have to do, to become the last of us. You won't regret it.,,P.S. You should really read the very short prequel comics first (before playing the game), written by the head writer of the game. They're official storyline, and really do add a lot of little neat things and details to the game that you wouldn't appreciate or would miss otherwise.;normal;English;10
ajslater;This is the best game I've every played and also the best movie I've seen in maybe a decade or more. The characters are incredible, the story is heartbreaking. This is so much better than a zombie game.

How Joel and Ellie eventually bond are are near inseparable i loved, the Combat is pretty decent, i did enjoy upgrading my equipment weapons ect saving parts for that next upgrade which would really help further into the game. The voice acting is amazing, the graphics are beautiful and the Difficulty hard+ is a good challenge, multiple attempts on Hard in many tense moments where had, always a fan of those ""collectibles"" scattered around the game which made me always double check my surroundings for those hidden items. Many tears where shed during the playing of this Game many times over, I initially was very excited on the announcement of Part 2 but the more we have been shown and told I am slightly uncertain and somewhat scared of the franchise, especially my strong belief they have killed Joel off screen an insult to how vital and important Joel is to the story and how Ellie and Joel are two pieces that fit. lets hope I am wrong and part 2 is amazing";normal;English;9
Polygoncrafter;The Last Of Us...A game that I liked the first time I played and finished it. The second time though, I realized that this is a game you spend 80% - 90% of your time crouching and sneaking that it becomes a chore and becomes boring. No replay value. The game is heavily stealth based which is not bad, but this game's stealth mechanics is a poor one. Maybe if they have included setting up traps and commanding your ai partner in the gameplay, it would have been more fun and engaging. Just because the story is dark and it's an emotional game, doesn't mean the gameplay shouldn't be. I think the only reason why a lot of people like this, me included is because of the voice acting and how real the characters are. But as a game, it doesn't offer much in the gameplay department. I would still recommend this game nonetheless as it's a great experience the first time but loses it magic if you replay it.;normal;English;5
GRI3VER_92;Played many times on ps3, bought the remastered for ps4 still playing it in 2k19, simply because the story is fantastic. This is a must play, game-play/controls are good and the graphics is good. Well clap clap Naughtydog.;expanded;English;10

Zeratex;The last of us is for me a good game, however it is pretty overrated, and putting it among the best games of all time is weird to me.,Sure the game does characters well, and the story while not so innovative with its zombie concept is well written and executed.,,The gameplay is intense with tight controls and challenging levels.,However game suffers from low gameplay variety options, you cant solve situations by different paths, sometimes you stealth sometimes you fight, thats all.,A.I is pretty bad and this makes the game silly sometimes.,Graphic wise the voice acting is super good.,,7.5/10;normal;English;7

roccstarsux;Oh boy, playing this game physically hurts me. The story is so poorly written and cliche, The characters are forced, especially towards the end. And the linearity of this game, like this game is more linear than a straight line. Why even make this a game, you barely have any control, just make it a tv show. Like the intro will play and then after that you get the opening credits for the first time and then after that you wake up as Joel. That episode can end around that time you first meet Ellie or when you make it out of the city. You'll have the same exact experience and it would work over all because in a video game you're expected to play as a character not play a cutscene. While having it a show will open it up to a much larger audience and it'll be much more successful.;normal;English;0

D-GAMER;An amazing new survival horror franchise from the creators of UNCHARTED (NAUGHTY DOG). A game that mix very well an emotional storytelling with STEALTH, SHOOTING, CRAFTING, MELEE COMBATS, HORROR, SUSPENSE... Beautiful graphics, amazing soundtrack. A MUST PLAY!;expanded;English;10
Coop123;The Last of Us Remastered may be one of the greatest games ever made. This was my first time experiencing the game having never played the original version. The only major differences in the remaster is an increase in frames and improved graphics. Even though the game is well over four years old, graphically it stands strong and is able to compete with the newest releases. The face animation is perfect and the environments and little details are amazing. The game also has a great sound direction that should not be over looked. Disturbing noises from the infected, the voice acting, and the phenomenal soundtrack add so much immersion and beauty to the game. The story is simple and definitely a concept you have seen before but this game shows you its all about execution. The way the world has changed and how they respond to something like a zombie invasion feels real and it really portrays how human beings behave and is a great study on human nature. The characters feel so honestly written and every moment and character introduced has a significant role to play making the story absolute perfection and a great step for narratives in video games. The story is sad and depressing and there are few true and happy moments in this game, but when there are it feels really unique. The biggest plus is the way you find yourself attached to the characters and how they grow and develop but another thing Naughty Dog did not fail at was the game-play. The game focuses on third person cover based shooting and stealth. The game gives you the option on how you can approach the enemies, and many different tools as well. Shooting and stealth feel really good but scavenging for items and choosing what to craft at what moment feels personalized and adds a lot of depth and fits the survival narrative. Switching between infected and the human enemies is a great design choice and fighting them is always nerve racking thanks to the way the communicate with one another or the disgusting sounds they make. The game is near perfection and the only complaint i have is the over reliance of moving crates and ladders. There are only a few nitpicks but overall the last of us is a truly special experience and is a must have for everyone.;normal;English;10

One of the best experiences of all time when it comes to gaming comes remastered to the PS4 (and with its excellent DLC) and it is as extraordinary as you would expect, even in comparison to the current gen titles. One of the best movie like campaigns of all time, with masterful music, voice acting, and story telling. Without a doubt a masterpiece and a most have.;normal;English;10
Xiao1Antonio;Didn't exactly need a remaster but I can play it on current gen instead of last so, not complaining.;expanded;English;10
Gamesearcher1;I had extremely high expectations for this game, more than many other critically-acclaimed games. But this game did something completely different. It massively surpassed them. The story revolves around Joel and Ellie, two extremely contrasting individuals on a life-altering quest. And their tale is certainly not a happy one. Along the way, you meet unforgettable characters, and witness some unforgettable moments. Combat is up first, and this was one of the aspects that nagged me before playing the game. But Naughty Dog did this really well. In every combat scenario, you can either do some cover shooting, or sneak past the enemies. There is a multitude of weapons to do this with, which are all found at a relatively good pace. But sneaking is by far the best option. Not only just food, drink, shelter and joy are in low quality here. Ammo is hard to come by, compared to other games, so Joel's motto of 'make them count' is absolutely true. You can interact with items around the world, and they will make your life easier. Bottles and bricks highlight the biggest flaw in the game, though. The AI. The AI is more broken than the world where the game is set. It is absolutely horrendous sometimes, and does take away from the realism, especially when people turn away from you, the person who they're meant to kill, to focus on a bottle. The zombie variants are small, but each one is extremely different, and are tackled very differently. Listen Mode is a handy tool available in the lower difficulties, that, for the lack of a better term, lets you see what you hear, and is useful whenever you find yourself in the same room as a couple infected, and need a plan. It also helps that the game also looks quite stellar, and the use of lighting is extremely notable. The game uses music rarely, and only for key moments. While I like the music, and it fits the game perfectly, there is a sheer lack of tracks. It just sounds like one track is used, although with its pace slowed or sped-up. I won't state anything about the story, because its something best experienced by the game itself, but the confusion, sorrow and shock displayed by the first chapter keeps rolling till the last. Nothing short of amazing.;normal;English;9

MrFettuccini;"The Naughty Dog game that introduced the ""movie games"" formula. Its action sequences provide a lot of suspence and its horror scenes are thrilling, but the story is overly linear and extremely unreplayable. I liked Joel as the protagonist.";expanded;English;8
fiachra;this might be the best game i have eve played. the developers create a a relationship not by hammering the concepts home, but by subtly and gently teasing out ideas that other games hamfistedly throw in our faces, the restraint here is phenomenal. there is a reason why this will be considered one of the best games of all time 100 years from now. a truly special game. naughty dog, take a bow.;expanded;English;10

Caerleon;"Of course this is a real masterpiece that everyone should play. A great story, the continuation of which we will see soon.,,I've never seen a world so beautifully destroyed. During the game we will be accompanied by incomparable music. It is visible that over characters long worked. They do not seem ""cardboard"" and empty. I believe Joel, I feel for Ellie.  Like would simple the plot about how as two try to find answers and survive in a new world, but this the simplicity is full depth.,,You might wonder, "" If you liked it, why only 7?"" It's all about the combat component of this game. Any fighting skirmish is like a puzzle. You listen to enemies, study their movement, find a pattern and quietly kill. The main problem is that each battle scene is similar to the previous one, only the locations change. After 3-4 hours it gets boring. You will have to take breaks, otherwise because of the constant boredom you throw the game.,,Many may say that it is possible to arrange a shoot. The gameplay is not meant to be that you took an active plot. Ammunition is sorely lacking.";normal;English;7
Domino---;Dialog writing is good, but the story is very cringe and the ending so predictable I actually accidentaly spoiled my wife by guessing what it would be.

SWise;The Last of Us is an amazing video game rather you have it on the PlayStation 4, or PlayStation 3. The game is labelled a sub-genre called action-adventure survival horror which is a mouthful. It has a beautiful atmosphere, and visuals are great. The gameplay is fun, and fits with the setting. It has minor flaws like repeating a few puzzles, but that's nothing to bad. I would recommend The Last of Us to anybody that loves a great, and compelling story.;normal;English;10
MathiasVoorhees;This game has one the most cliché stories I have ever seen: A guy has to get a girl somewhere because she is immune to the virus and can save humanity, oh boy have I heard that somewhere before, literally almost every zombie movie. The AI is braindead and Ellie wouldn't stop going near enemies basically ruining my stealth. The ending is bafflingly stupid, the graphics are not even that good.

Th3Gam3rGer;I've finally found the time to review my favorite game of all time! The Last of Us is literally the best game I have ever played. It nails everything! The story, characters, gameplay, presentation, atmosphere, music, soundtrack, pacing are all top-notch!  TLOU has been one of the most memorable gaming experiences of my life. I was 16 years old at the time of release (June 2013 on PS3) and I've never played a videogame before that is so riveting, emotional moving and so relatable in many ways. The journey of Joel and Ellie is brutal, violent, hopeless and yet so beautiful. The love between these two characters and the relationship that is developing throughout the game is the centerpiece of the experience. You can easily put yourself in Ellie and Joel's shoes, because every action they make is understandable and relatable. I can't wait to play the continuation of Ellie and Joel's journey!! Thank you Naughty Dog for creating this world and these unforgettable characters! The PS4 version is the best way to experience this masterpiece!;normal;English;10
InternetPerson1;The Last of Us is easily one of the greatest games of all time if not the greatest. This game is pure art and will go down as a classic. Visually the game is stunning with barren empty towns and sunlight shining down on it or musty corridors the game looks fantastic. The characters here are written so well and made so honest and sincere. I do not want to describe much of the character growth to avoid spoilers, but i must say this game will make you forget everything and you will feel like Joel and Ellie are actual human beings. The plot behind the game is a basic standard zombie story but done in a unique way. The way you see how humans behave in this game after the apocalypse says a lot about human behavior and what people are really like. The original soundtrack is beautiful and gives you chills every-time you hear it. The game play is perfect as well mixing Shooting, crafting, and a lot of patience and thinking. The enemy encounters are switched up with humans and clickers and runners and perhaps the clickers. The game is intense and nerve racking and will frustrate you and actually make you fearful. All wrapped up in quite moments with Joel and Ellie doing simple tasks with real human dialog. This game is a masterpiece and i recommend it to anyone.;normal;English;10

I'd get more out of this if I watched a well scripted condensed edited lets play on the Internet for sure.,,Full of scripted cheating BS that forces you into stupid insane avoidable situations. Oh and the combat is so unrefined to the point of jank. What is with the slow cumbersome wobbly aim of a geriatric in a care home. So like have the developers really ever picked up a bow/pistol/rifle and shot one ffs? Melee that glitches out with really shoddy camera angles.,,Seriously NFW Joel should be dead round about the horse section, but no spoilers, so... I liked the Joel character enough, but Ellie the swearing edgy mary sue teen character not so much. Another teen character is in the game and I was convinced that they was just a teen not going on forty like Ellie. Hyped game, scripted idiocy, unconvincing character development on the Ellie part, shoddy gameplay mechanics.,,It is meh gameplay to ok story, but nothing really at all special.

Kaicha;Even in 2018 we are impressed by the quality of animations and graphics of Last of Us. The voice acting and overall interaction between the characters gives this game a real-life feeling.,,Whilst the combat becomes repetitive, it is well immersed into the dynamics of the settings (limited resources, stealth, Us VS Them, etc.).,,The plot is intriguing while not being cheesy and there are small twists at the right times. Even the longest chapters do not feel tedious and there is no sense of fillers being added just for the sake of extending game time.,,The ending was a good conclusion to the tale, and gives a good sense of closure.;normal;English;10
Embracemind;Hear me out, this game shouldn't be ranked at all, this game is my all time favorite in every video game genre, I've never felt more immersed in a somewhat *not real* universe until I started this adventure, this is simply a god send.

dimaeatworld;In one word, it is a masterpiece in the video game history. If you still haven't played this game, do that.,,I'm not going to write usual information such as the history of the game, genre and so on. I'm going to describe emotions which the game can share with you. Because this game, first of all, is about emotions. Then it is about shooting, zombies, post-apocalypse.,,You won't be the main decision maker or a  central person. Accept this idea and relax. You are a spectator. Of course, you will shoot, hide, craft, upgrade skills, fear and do one hundred typical adventure actions. But the core of the game-play is to watch how relations between Joel and Elie change and grow. And it is amazing. I think the developers specially made a choice for Elie's age as 13 years old. They have crossed out all potential questions about sexuality between heroes. It helps leave only a human layer without gender problems. A risky tactic in the 21 century with sexual pop culture.,,So, you will be an invisible part of the crew consisting of old cynical Joel and young cheeky Elie at the end of the times. And keep in mind, that zombies are a simple environment. The developers can change them to werewolves, vampires, aliens... It is not important, because all the stories in our lives are always about people. And you will understand that the most dangerous monster in a man. He is unpredictable, he kills for fun, he is smart and always lies.,,Anyway, I can promise, you are going to believe in Joel and Elie. They will take a place in your memories as real people. And you will love them.,,The general questions which the authors took as background for the game are who we are. What does make us humane? Does mankind have a chance for something bigger than we have now?,,PS. Most of the reviews of the game skip describing the soundtrack of the game. Author of it is Gustavo Santaolalla and he conveyed a strong and deep feeling of the world from Last of Us.;normal;English;10
brainstormer;"The Last of Us is a great survival horror game that succeeds on providing a compelling story and an intense gameplay. It oozes with atmosphere and style, and it is truly one of the best games games for PS4. But, that being said, it does have some flaws, and those flaws mainly being the mediocre AI and the occasional breakage of immersion. These flaws are by no means game-breaking, however they do affect the overall experience in a minor but noticeable way.,The gameplay is intense and appropriate for its overall theme, however it does get a bit tedious at times, especially the ""platforming"" segments sometimes being slow. The action can get really intense and these segments do require strategic planning. Whether you want to play stealthy or guns blazing, that's your choice, however, since this is a survival game, there will be a shortage of ammo and resources so you better choose carefully your style of playing and balancing these ways of playing is essential, especially on high difficulties. The shooting feels heavy and impactful, just like it should since this game strives for realism more than not, and while it doesn't totally succeed at that, it still does a fine job at delivering an intense experience.  The melee combat also feels punchy and it is brutal. The crafting system is nice, adding to the survival aspect of the game. Searching for materials increases the importance of exploration, which is key for crafting and for gathering materials to upgrade certain elements of your gear. There are two main types of enemies: human enemies and infected enemies. Both types can offer intense challenges. And there are different kinds of infected enemies and human enemies, all of them being well designed, So the gameplay is appropriate to the game's gritty and dark theme by being intense and brutal, thus adding to the immersion, But what diminishes the immersion is the occasional non-sense whenever your friendly AI goes face to face with the enemy, and the enemy doesn't detect your companion. While it does somehow make sense that this is the case and I do understand that it is hard to program an AI in a way for it to always act perfectly, it just is a bit ridiculous sometimes.,The story has some very compelling characters and the dialogue, the voice acting... they are top-notch. Its writing seriously rivals those of Hollywood movies. It is cinematic, emotional and intense. I know, I've used the word ""intense"" many times by now, but that's the perfect description for this game. It is its main essence. And, while these stories have been done before, it's still done here with expertise and with care. Many people say that this game could've easily been made as a movie, and that is true. But the game itself doesn't want to be a movie, since the gameplay is still very substantial and enjoyable. This is easily the best cinematic game that I've ever played.";normal;English;9
tomvs123;"As a zombie fan and amazing story lover, I was looking forward to playing this one. But, I was disappointed.,,To put it simply: This is a great game for the average gamer who has never experienced a good story, and who doesn't mind plot holes. But for the story lovers and those of us who are looking for new experiences in video games, you might be disappointed.,,The gameplay is really what this game is all about. Gameplay comes first and the story was built around it. And it's just a run-of-the-mill 3rd person action/stealth game, much like the Uncharted games, though there's more emphasis on inventory management and stealth in this game.,,During gameplay, you'll be going to a new area, killing everything that moves, and then going to the next area. Repeat that about 100 times to beat the game.,,What's worst about most of the gameplay is that it makes no sense story-wise. Why is it necessary to kill all other people I meet? Why do people instantly want to kill me on sight? Why do random people suddenly show up at my location at the exact same time I show up (and attempt to murder me)? It's not explained. It's just how the game works. The only time where you get to talk to other humans, rather than killing them is in cut scenes. It makes the story feel quite forced and disconnected from the gameplay.,,For the various story scenarios, basically take every zombie tv show and movie made before this game, nab all of the best scenes, and then put them into this game. I really felt like I was watching a rerun. This isn't necessarily bad, but again, I'm looking for a new experience and not the same-old zombie stuff.,,As for the main plot, it's quite weak and full of plot holes. Without spoiling anything, the main character (that you play primarily) is just a selfish/greedy old man that the game tries to portray as being heroic and just. His actions don't make sense, unless you accept that he's just stupid. He just ""believes"" things are right and does them, despite the evidence in front of him. And you don't get to go on a journey to find more evidence or to learn more about the world: instead your journey is full of murdering everyone that disagrees with you.,,The story just doesn't hold up to scrutiny and is actually quite bad when completely dissected. Though I must say that the little girl sections of it weren't that bad because she actually acts believably given her circumstances.,,So, the game isn't really for me, though I prefer stories with minimal plot holes, reasonable character actions, and gameplay that doesn't directly conflict with the story. Though for those who love Uncharted, this might be right up your alley.";normal;English;3
Alex_Pilgrim008;An awesome PS4 remaster of the PS3's best game. It's a must own, even for those who bought the original. The visual upgrade is impressive. This is the definitive version thanks to higher resolution textures, an increased draw distance and an improved framerate. The game includes cutscene audio commentary, a photo mode, the Left Behind DLC and extra multiplayer maps. In addition, the PS4's light bar changes color according to the character's health. You can also hear the audio clips through the PS4's speaker. And if you want to view the original game's graphics, you can with the touch of a button. Overall, this is a terrific remaster. If you've never played it before, you're in for a great ride. I would rate this with a 10 out of 10.;normal;English;10
Bleh1672;I didn’t get much out of the remaster, aside from fewer minor glitches than the original version.,,The game is still amazing. The writing is still amazing. The performances are still amazing. The visuals are still stunning. The music is still unique and very fitting.,,I think the thing I like the most about the overall story is that it focusses so little on the world at large. The issues the characters face are really quite small in the grand view of things. Terrible, yes. But small. But that’s what makes it so hard and sad and uncomfortable. We can become detached about bad things when we don’t experience them personally. But these characters are so real and we grow so attached to them that we do experience the tragedies personally, in a way.,,And in order to do that the story HAS to be small and only focus on a few people.,,Only a consistently solid company like Naughty Dog could craft such a singularly perfect experience. Even their worst games are some of the best games out there. It’s going to be so exciting to see where they take this world going forward.;normal;English;10

fishbone76;I didn't knew much about this game only that people praised it. So when I decided to buy a PS4 I got it with this game.,So I plunged into this game without any knowledge except it is some kind of zombie outbreak apocalypse game XD,I was amazed by the graphics which still look good today. It didn't took me long to get hooked on the story and it's characters.,If there's one thing you can trust naughty dog it's their story telling and deep character development.,Also this game has one of the best combat and crafting menus.,I replayed this game several times but never dared to play on a hard level.,The soundtrack and the post apocalyptic setting is beautifully crafted.,The game never gets boring because you visit so many different regions.,If you want an epic game experience with a fantastic crafted story and characters and some (optional stealth but not always possible) combat this game is for you.,Also I cry every time during the end of the game.;normal;English;10

Peter_Parker23;This is hands down the greatest video game of all time, it has been since it came out and even with all these amazing games like God of War, Uncharted 4  and Spider-Man coming out, The Last of Us remains at the top. Simply a masterpiece.;expanded;English;10
TatsMcGee;This is a game that I have been wanting to play for awhile, I bought it a few months back and then it was just sitting and collecting dust. I finally decided that I would give it a shot. The Uncharted franchise is one of my favorite franchises and I felt some internal pressure to play this game as well.,,I’m really over the whole Zombie craze and knowing the game is essentially about Zombies, I knew I would have to be in the mood to play a game like this. I am very glad that I did finally sit down and play through the game.,,The story is pretty good or at least in opinion as good as it can be when a story is written about a Zombie apocalypse. The driving force of this game are the two main characters and most importantly the development of these two characters. You have an older gentleman named Joel who goes through a traumatic event right at the start of the game and Ellie who is a young girl. She is 14 years old and has gone through her own struggles. The two start out as Strangers but as the game moves forward, the two start to develop a bond.,,I enjoyed the gameplay to an extent. The shooting is just like Uncharted, there is a lot less traversing landscapes and buildings and a lot more stealth. As I’m sure you’re aware, I’m not crazy about Stealth but this games stealth isn’t the worst thing. As long as you’re quiet you can move along and not have to worry about it too much.,,My biggest gripe about the game is, it can start to feel repetitive towards the end. There is one particular “puzzle” where you need to escort Ellie across a body of water. She is unable to swim so you need to find a wooden pallet to escort her over the water. After about the first couple times doing that, I was kind of sick of doing it. It doesn’t happen too often but maybe 3-5 times in a single playthrough.,,This is a very well made game but I do like the Uncharted series more. It comes down to personal preference but this is a darker game, it takes itself very seriously. It’s not a case where it takes itself so seriously that it has a stick up its ass but its a much more serious tone.,,It is also important to note that I played this game on easy, I don’t play linear action-adventures for a challenging experience. It’s more to sit back, play the game and really enjoy the story.;normal;English;9

jrdnnn;Finally playing this game after 5 years and it's worth the wait. Last of Us Remastered is a quintessential PS4 game and one of the most emotional storylines I've witnessed across all media. The quest of Joel and Ellie is touching, tense, brutal and shocking, and they are two of the strongest videogame characters of the decade. I absolutely loved every aspect of the story and can't fault it - this game takes the rough idea behind The Walking Dead and truly does justice to the human vs. human in an apocalyptic society trope, unlike the aforementioned TV show.,,Gameplay-wise, I enjoyed most of it. The controls are tight, combat (especially gunplay) is solid, the on-the-fly crafting mechanics were great and the exploration was pretty good. The upgrade trees for weapons and skills felt a little insignificant in the long-run and prevented true enhancements. The absence of incentives for exploring off the beaten path however were poor compared to the Uncharted series and was a disappointment to me. The world is gorgeous and interesting, yet basically boiled down to a corridor-type approach with occasional locked doors to explore. Considering the setting and style of game, this is a major flaw in my opinion. This said, I was never bored, loved the environments and the graphics are fantastic, I just wanted more variety in game progression akin to all the optional caves and treasures of, say, Tomb Raider or Uncharted 4.,,The production values of the game are incredible. Light effects, the score, the environments, the small touches to abandoned houses, the facial animations - amazing. This game is a true experience to play through, both visually and emotionally, and is without a doubt deserving of the praise it gets in these respects. The DLC was really nice for a bit of background to Ellie and only helped me love her more. Despite some gameplay issues for me, Last of Us joins Bloodborne, Uncharted 4, Nier: Automata and Horizon : Zero Dawn in the ranks of games you simply must play if you own a PS4, but for reasons different to the other four. This is the most engaging and personal story I think I've came across in gaming since some of the PSOne Final Fantasies or Metal Gear Solid 3, and what it lacks in gameplay/exploration depth, it makes up for in spades with the raw emotion and intricacy of its heartbreaking narrative.;normal;English;8

FreedomFighters;"I guess it's worth addressing the elephant in the room for a second: ""The Last of Us"" is the first post-""Crash Bandicoot"" Naughty Dog game that I've played, and given that I played and beat the original ""Crash Bandicoot"" trilogy only as part of the Vicarious Visions ""N-Sane Trilogy"" remakes (instead of their original versions), this is essentially the first game fully developed by Naughty Dog that I have played and beaten. And admittedly, I approached this one with some very real caution: yes, the game received glowing reviews and many Game of the Year awards back in 2013, but so too did ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" a game I somewhat notoriously (or maybe I just think that) rated a 7 out of 10 in my review, contrary to the 9 and 10 scores that everyone was handing out to it left and right. Even if ""The Last of Us"" was a completely different game, it became clear as soon as I handed that score to ""Grand Theft Auto V"" that even one of the most beloved and popular games of all-time didn't do it for me, so I actually worried that ""The Last of Us"" would suffer the same fate. Fortunately, dear readers, it didn't. In fact, it ended up becoming one of my personal favorite games.,""The Last of Us"" is a wonder to behold in basically every facet: the story is moving and emotional, is excellent in its handling of themes like survival, family, togetherness, and even subtle themes of gender roles and sexuality. Furthermore, considering that I'm not very good at crying, the fact that this game got me pretty damn close to crying at several points is really something. The characters are also impeccably written (specifically Ellie, who is the true highlight of the game), and the relationship between Joel and Ellie is fantastic, as it's the perfect example of true, genuine, legitimately character growth in a story. Each character, even down to the secondary ones, are also further brought to life by an array of excellent performances from its very talented cast, and I find the moral ambiguity and flawed nature of the characters to be extremely fascinating, as it brings an air of realness to them. The game's post-apocalyptic world is brilliantly designed and believably lonely, able to mask the fact that it is so linear by still giving you plenty of areas to explore, and the graphics are absolutely breathtaking (the added PS4 facelift only helps to bring them out further). I also love the game's use of music and sound, and I find that the often lighter, more haunting nature of the sound design only helps add to the loneliness that the world tries to create. Also, while I initially worried going into the game that the gameplay would suffer as a result of the emphasis on story, I'm happy to report that I was very wrong: the gameplay is fantastic. The game's crafting system adds an interesting air of strategy to the game and keeps you on your toes, the combat is engrossing and exciting, and the stealth sections are also extremely satisfying. Oh, and getting to play the game at 60 frames per second thanks to this remaster only helps make for a more smooth gameplay experience.,If there is one EXTREMELY minor flaw I can mention about the game, it's that the enemy AI can be just a tad bit wonky during stealth sections, but said sections are so tensing and edge-of-your-seat thrilling that it's honestly easy to look past.,This is it: this really is one of the finest video games ever made. I was skeptical at first, but ""The Last of Us"" hooked me in right from the jump and never let me go. If you haven't gotten a chance to play this masterpiece yet...stop whatever you're doing and fix that!,Final rating: 10 out of 10 ""Fantastic""";normal;English;10

huiboy;An immersive story that takes you through an incredibly emotional and thrilling journey. Looking back as the credits roll, the bond you build with one of the most iconic characters in gaming is one of the greatest in any game I’ve played. We’ve been through a lot, traveled far, hurdled through countless obstacles and zombies and met a bunch of people on the way. It’s hard to believe this level of story telling was done through a game and yet it may have only been possible this way. Good job Naughty,Dog for giving us another great game- I look forward to much to come.,,Gameplay: fun and rewarding combat system and puzzles that do not feel repetitive or frustrating.  I recommend playing on hard difficulty to ensure you can’t exploit the AIs too much and to feel the danger they are facing.,,Art: incredible especially near the end of the story. Elie looks gorgeous.,,Voice acting: I couldn’t think of anyone better suited for the job. I wouldn’t have it any other way,,Enjoyment: 8.5/10 Most of the times I just wanted to get the story rolling but not one time did I not have a good time during the combat or puzzle solving areas. Some areas were challenging on hard mode but rewarding when I finished. A little bleak at times but I blame that on my low patience. I recommend beating this game in large sittings.;normal;English;9

Dr_Paganini;"What can I say about ""The Last of Us"" that hasn't been said already. Well It'd have to be MY personal experience with it. It took me 4 years to buy this game. Mainly due to my concern being that it was ""Uncharted"" with a zombie twist. Plain and simple I was dead wrong. This is what games should aspire to be. This is the only game that I've ever cried in. Not because I was sad or frustrated but because it was more beautiful than i expected. The story alone should be enough to buy it. It was able to emotionally grip me and have me so invested that I couldn't put down my controller because i felt i needed to go on. The game play is pretty basic but it does it so well that it isn't a bad thing. Much like how ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" takes the best elements of Open-World games and makes them better, ""The Last of US"" does the same thing by taking the cover-shooter elements from ""Uncharted"" but makes it WAY more brutal and raw that you feel the impact of your bullets and punches. Unlike most zombie games I've played, the infected actually pose a much more real threat than humans do. Most might see this as a bad thing but personally i don't. What makes the infected encounters so intense is that you have VERY limited ammo. So you have to play smart by crafting shivs and manipulating the AI by throwing bricks/bottles in the opposite direction.The same can be said about the humans but unlike the infected you don't feel as scared because they're just like you and that means you don't feel as obligated to play smart which gives you the ability to go ham with your shotgun. If by now you aren't convinced to buy this game, then i don't know what will. This is what a masterpiece looks like and most games wish they could achieve this level of greatness.";normal;English;10

Nate3nate;"TLOU is the most overrated game in gaming history, nothing about it is above a 5.  The ambiance is generic Half-Life 2 meets Zombies (go play HL2 and tell me the whole camp/atmosphere doesn't feel like a complete rip), the store is generic zombie virus outbreak with nothing new, the characters are bland, the game play is boring, and the puzzles can be solved by my dog (my literal dog who has paws which you would think would make the puzzles challenging but nah).,,I could go on and break down every part of this travesty of a game, but I'll ask 1 simple question which I know none of the people that loved this game asked.,,Why did the soldier shoot your daughter?,,There is no reason that at the beginning of the outbreak, when no one could possibly know what is going on, the soldier would have fired upon you or that the soldier's commander would have ordered it.  Remember this outbreak wasn't something that had been ongoing for a long time, this just happened straight up in the night, and because of it the military was mobilized.  Hell even if they knew something crazy was going on the military doesn't just shoot civilians, especially considering that soldier was as green as they come (probably national guard).  That whole dramatic scene makes no sense once you think about it and the same can be said for pretty much everything else after that.,,Run down guy who double crossed you and viciously beat/murder him, but rebel lady threatens you and suddenly you're all soft now?  Yeah that's not how real life works.,,Random girl holds the key to ending the outbreak but suddenly your character decides she's more important to him personally so they run off?  F humanity right?  So all the daughters in the world will suffer and die but generic male character number 1 doesn't care cause he's got one of his own right here.  (That's super creepy btw),,The story is completely full of logical fallacies that the ""10ers"" clearly did not stop to actually think about.  But fine, I expect that from most people, so hows the game play?,,Well do you like stealth games that do the stealth well, say Splinter Cell?,,Yeah well the stealth in this game is garbage.,,Do you like games that have interesting level design and allow you to chose your timing vs enemies when using stealth?,,Too bad, you're always a ledge drop away from not being able to back track and thus being stuck in a room with ZOMBIES THAT CANNOT CLIMB SO IF YOUR CHARACTER GOT HIS HEAD OUT OF HIS ASS HE WOULD JUST ALERT THE ZOMBIES FROM UP HIGH AND KILL THEM ALL WITHOUT ISSUE BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO your character is too damn stupid to actually develop a strategy vs zombies that makes any sense.,,Do you like weapons?,,Ha!  No weapons for you!  You get shivs, really poorly crafted shivs and if you don't have those you're pretty much f'ed because lord knows in a post apocalyptic wasteland there's never any knives to be had.  God forbid your character ever gets an actual melee weapon.,,Hey remember those spore puffs that can infect people?  Yeah they only do that when the plot needs them too, otherwise your character pretty much just ignores them after the first scene with them.,,Look...,,You want a game with great story?,Go play Knights of the Old Republic,,You want a game with great stealth?,Go play Splinter Cell Conviction,,You want a game with great combat?,Go play Battlefield 3,,You want a game with great crafting?,Go play Space Engineers,,You want a game with great tactics/strategy?,Go play Xcom/Xcom 2,,You want a game with great level design?,Go play Deus Ex Human Revolution,,You want a great zombie game?,Go play Dying Light,Why yes I do play a wide verity of games and have been playing games for a good chunk of time now.  Regardless, my point is that TLOU does nothing better than anyone else or even close and if you think it does, go play these other games and see what actual great games are.    TL:DR - Go play something else, this game isn't worth your time and if this is the first game you've ever played please play something on my list before you rate this game and see for yourself how absolutely mediocre TLOU is.";normal;English;5

Gittoplo;I have heard so much about this game that I had to have a look. These are my thoughts:,,- The game, despite the remastering, still feels a little dated.,- The game reminded me very much of Uncharted series. The same studio and naturally same feel to it. The only difference is the setting. This is Walking Dead compared to Indiana Jones. For me, Indiana always triumphs over Walking Dead (the actual series is very underwhelming 7/10 for me). For this reason, I am giving this game a solid 7/10. I have marked Uncharted as 8/10.,- Interesting and well thought out characters.,- Good level design but somewhat linear which is expected.,,All in all, I can see why it is regarded as a classic and I  did enjoy it but not as much as I expected. I had a repelling feeling about it as I bought the game and only played for the first time many months later. Each time I played it, I did so to just finish it and tick the box, but while at it I did enjoy it.,- The game was consistent and had quite a few tense and exciting moments.,,Am I looking forward to the second instalment?

kiank;The Last of Us: Remastered is an amazing game with one of the best stories in all of gaming.  Joel, Ellie, and Marline are all such strong and amazing characters.  The games opening scene almost had me in tears as Sarah's death was so emotional.  Tess was a great compliment to Joel and she matched him in ruggedness.  Bill is a funny character and another great LGBT representation.  Ellie is such a badass and she is such a strong figure, not only as a female character but also as a LGBT character.  Having cannibals, hunters, and infected creates such an amazing dynamic and I think they have an accurate description of what would happen if this infection occurred.  I think it's similar to The Road.  The scene with Henry and Sam is the most emotional scene in video game history.  Joel's brother shows the very hopeful side of the Last of Us and how civilization and love can persist.  And when Ellie is alone in the winter, her character gets really developed and the whole face off with David is incredible and emotional.  Furthermore, the ending is incredible with Marline's death and Joel lying to Ellie.  It sets up part II incredibly!  Left Behind is an awesome edition to Ellie's character.  Overall, I would give it a 10.0!;normal;English;10

Frostyjulio;This is an absolutely beautiful game with great story telling, graphics, mechanics and over all one of the best games i ever played on the ps3/ps4. the only real down fall i feel that this game had was that they should have done a multiplayer mode where clcikers or runners where involved but over all a great game.;expanded;English;9
TheCornflex;I heard so much positive about this game but after playing it I was really shocked. The presentation is the only positive thing about this game. Gameplay is so boring and undynamic. Man, I don't even feel like helping the protagonist to survive.;expanded;English;4
CodeJerry;The story is very fun. The gameplay is uncharted but those sections where stealth is needed all the time. Story is around 8. Gameplay 7 because uncharted is just great. Skill builds are nice but so slow. They require you to play the story 10 times before you can actually upgrade fully. Seriously that is soooo damn boring i can see why its only a 2% trophy. Multiplayer is a joke. 60% of all skills are locked and must be paid cash for. Skills that really do make a god damn difference like autopicking up ammo or getting 3x more crafting items. Oh and weapons get used to the very few they give you. But that doesn't matter anyway just buy a tactical shotgun(can't get without cash sorry, infact you can't own any shotgun without paying) and its the only gun you need and the one everyone uses.;normal;English;3
HoRuzz;Oh, my God ... That's 12/10 !!! This is really a beautiful story of heroes ... I will recommend this game to my children! Thanks to Naughty Dog for this amazing experience;expanded;English;10
Lotap;Best game I ever played. True masterpiece. Does not lack in any department. The story is awesome and so is the gameplay. It's not a fighting game, but I still remember punching zombies in the face. It feels so good. Online is awesome too, but its kinda broken by microtransactions. But still I couldn't lower the rating, because TLOU is a game based on single player story.;expanded;English;10
bonsai;This game gave me so many emotions, it's impossible to understand unless you played thus gem.;expanded;English;10
visiblelight7;"Finished the game. Really extremely overrated.  I was expecting something incredible to happen based on the reviews but I honestly found the story didn't have any ""wow"" moments. It was just running from one building through a sewer to the next with a little cut scene here and there but nothing glorious at all or epic. I feel the reviews are just impressive because it's the first game that has that american cinema movie feel to it but like I said the story has no plot twists or anything that's exciting added to the story. It's just very bland I found myself just going through the motions expecting something to happen....but nothing happened.";normal;English;5
Rakean;"The story is amazing, ,tells a story about a man who loses his daughter at the beginning of the game and ""smuggling"" a little 14 year old girl, as you progress through the game you realise how connected you are with both Ellie and Joel. mULTIPLAYER IS AMAZING AS WELL AND UNIQUE IN ITS OWN WAY. Naughty Dog always impresses me.";expanded;English;10
teemz22;The first time I played through tlou on ps3 i was blown away by the game, the story was solid and the characters were great. You can say I was awestruck in a good way.,,3 years later, i played it on ps4 (+ the dlc), the play through wasn't as exciting as the first time I tried the game, definitely 60 fps helps the game play a lot, but the second time you play it  it's just not the same. I guess you can see the games flaws and limitations better, don't get me wrong it's a solid experience but giving the game a 10/10 just because the story and the characters, really?,,the replay value of this game is close to 0 for me and the dlc was just, pointless really.,,this is the perfect game for a casual gamer I guess, it's really great but nevertheless overrated as hell.;normal;English;8

BlueKetsueki;I love the last of us great story and setting but i think in terms of gameplay its kinda lacking was not a fan of the combat at all, while i would say to most people buy it and you will love it the bare bones of the game the gun play and sneaking didn't do it for me a great single experience with an ok multiplayer, i am really looking forward to the last of us 2 and hope its gives us the same great story with some improvements to the gameplay.;normal;English;8
Mats2468;Well .. What's so amazing with this game? Absolutely everything you've dreamed about in a game is a reality here. The story, the characters, the game mechanism and etc. Possibly one of PlayStation's all time best with Uncharted 4, period.;expanded;English;10

vladpostolache;I've been playing video games since before I went to school, so I've already been through the golden age of ZX Spectrums, 8-color games, Elite: Dangerous, followed by Doom, Quake, all the Blizzard masterpieces, then on to more modern games like Bioshock, Dead Space and Fallout. But I can't remember another game that got me so hooked as this one here. The story is so compelling, I found myself wanting to put down the controller to get some sleep only to notice the sun rising through the window, like when I was a child and I was fighting the hordes of undead in Diablo. You just can't let go. And while the graphics aren't top notch, they are as perfect as they need to be. The faces are exceptionally expressive, there's body language, there are even muscle movements almost imperceptible if you're not looking for them, but so important in the big picture. The voice over of the characters take you inside the game and you can't help but fall in love with Joel and Ellie. This is truly a masterpiece of video games. There's no wonder it's in the top of all the game review websites. I can't wait to begin the sequel, Left Behind.;normal;English;10
pappm94;One of the best, if not the best single player experience in my life. The story is so engaging, the storytelling is superb, it really takes advantage of the fact that it's a videogame. Great job Naughty Dog, I can't wait to play the 2nd part!,By the way, the game is recommended only for adults. Not only because of the violence, but understanding and appreciating the story requires a grown-up mind.;normal;English;10
OlegLeppik;One of the best games i've played. Everything is gorgerous. Perfect gameplay, ideal damage balance, plot is interesting to watch, soundtrack is 10/10, weapons realization is realistic. Absolute musthave on PS4. No doubt - it's a brilliant of gaming industry. Thank you, Naughty Dog, waiting for part 2.;expanded;English;10
Aginagala;The last of us will always be one of my favorite games of all time. Having it remastered brought back all the old nostalgic feelings of when I first played the game. I fell in love with Joel and Ellie and was one of the few games when as I was coming to the last bit of it... I genuinely did not want it to finish.,,The gameplay mechanics are a little bit strange to control at times as Joel wouldn't follow what I was telling him to do, and Ellie running out in front of a bunch of guys or clickers... slightly ruined the immersion but that being said it did not take away that I loved the game, I loved the characters and everything about the story. A fresh new addition building on the kind of escort time game... however never feeling like that as Ellie is helpful, witty, and you genuinely care about her. Another thing I loved about the game is that I have not felt this scared, intimidated and or tense about the zombies in games in a long long time. I loved the feeling of not wanting to be caught and if I did it was over, making you have to be stealthy rather than other games where you can get away with just running around everything, you have to play the game as it's supposed to be played.,,The RPG aspect of the game was also interesting as resources were very scarce rather than a lot of games having an abundance of them laying everywhere, made for a much more believable experience, especially when playing on the harder grounded mode. Quickly crafting a health kit, or perhaps preparing and monitoring your avaliable resources carefully made you think more about what you were doing and for much more intense action and stealth scenes.,,Moreover the new types of zombie known as clickers and their gameplay aspects being different to that of normal zombies... was fantastically implemented as not only did they relate to the story, but they were also terrifying. Coming back and playing it on the PS4 with fixed mechanics genuinely felt like I was in a movie at times with animation and voice acting by award winning Troy Baker and others, emotional scenes felt genuinely moving. This game was the reason for me buying a PS4 in the first place and it is a definite must play for any types of game lovers, fantastic story, brilliant new ideas and concepts along with engaging gameplay, a masterpiece of game design.;normal;English;9
TheResistente;"The last of us is a good game with an interesting story and very good characters. The pros are:,,Pros:,-Good story,-Good characters,-Unique model of the ""Zombies"",-Good multiplayer,-Items that are scarce (which is very necessary for these games),-Good combat,,This game is highly recommended. All your points are good, the truth is that they impressed me.";expanded;English;10
legeliclya;Thought I would be getting a great game. I was wrong. With The Last of Us comes a compelling story ruined by repetitive and boring gameplay, and a cringy 14 year old. At least she redeems herself in the later half of the game, as my favourite part of the game was the winter season, and I enjoyed the Left Behind DLC much more than the main game.;expanded;English;7
overlordofgeek;m a s t er p i e ce.. great script, great dialogue, good part designs Last of Us is definitely one of the best games ever. Of course there are missing. for example, artificial intelligence can really bother you at some points. and sometimes it can repeat itself. but these do not change the fact that the game is incredible. 90/100;expanded;English;9

Filsco;Great story, gameplay and it looks amazing. Characters are likable and you actually care about them and what happens to them in future. I enjoyed this game very much.;expanded;English;10
jennbenn86;There is nothing quite like this game. The ever evolving bond between Ellie and Joel is what propels this journey and it's two protagonists into something that you intensely care about. The characters are so well formed, yet we get to experience further growth and depth as the game unravels. Not to mention the fantastic world that houses this game. Overall, it does air on the side of violence and gore, but I'd hate for that be a deterrent for people to play it, there is so SO much more to it.  Utter masterpiece.;normal;English;10
JonatasHS;In conclusion, The Last of Us is a magnificent game, worthy of being considered a masterpiece, we were able to enter the game completely and created a new world where all that is shown to us is real, the game is beautiful and with this upgrade managed to stay more Also, one of the few problems I had with the game was artificial intelligence that is not very smart and that many times Ellie passes in front of the enemies and is not noticed, but otherwise the game is worthy to be played by all, the emotional load placed on each character is incredible and is also passed to the player, there is still time to play before the continuation and get ready for the great game that should also be.;normal;English;10
CccyrussS;Truly, this is the best greatest video game of all time. There are so many different undercurrents and emotional hooks that nothing else quite compares. Plus it's actually exciting and scary without resorting to body horror. Everybody should play this game.;expanded;English;10

ERDEM2468;Peoples thinks good characters and good charater relationships means good stroy. TLOU doesn't have a good story. Game has a very simple story.

JuanLuisGG14;Amazing and strong narrative pushes the limits of realism in this crude world. The Last of Us succeeds creating a dense atmosphere, tense situations and a compelling storyline that not many games achieve.,In addition, it isn't a slog to play as other Naughty games. This is mainly because mechanics are clever and interesting. Use of the environment and crafting are on point,,Just masterful;expanded;English;10
TrophyHunter14;What is there to say. Only game that is better (to me) is NieR:Automata. Both of them are masterpieces tho. Amazing graphics, amazing combat and amazing story mixed with hundreds of small details make it a 10/10.;expanded;English;10
Direwolf73;I broke down and bought a Playstation 4 because it came with this game and Uncharted 4. I also picked up the original Uncharted collection. These were games I always wanted to play. Nothing could have prepared be for the gut punch and emotions Last Of Us dropped on me. From a story perspective I do not recall playing a game with the same emotional punch ever. Voice acting and writing was A+++. Graphics on the remastered version were exquisite.,,From a game mechanics standpoint it was my first PS game ever and I had a lot of learning to do. It took time and felt off at times but once I figured everything out I was completely immersed in the greatness that was this game.;normal;English;10
OnPointGamer;Experience a true PS3 masterpiece for the PS4, now Remastered, by the team at Naughty Dog. You can't go wrong with the best storytellers in the gaming industry with Naughty Dog.;expanded;English;10
kunal2989;I played this game after playing all the uncharted games and I was well aware of the hype this game has. Also, I am not a big survival horror fan. So, my expectations were already sky high. The last of us delivers on every account. Storytelling, game-play and visuals are top notch. It is unconventional and yet not pretentious. Every time you start getting comfortable with the game, it demands you to get out of your comfortable zone. The characters are well written and you develop a genuine relationship with their story. The environment is eerie, hopeless and almost everyone is morally ambiguous, thus the whole experience feels mature. Long story short, last of us is immensely satisfying. 5/5;normal;English;10
Batmandude46;Even when remastered on to the new gen of consoles, this game is one of the best games ever made. Amazing story, Great gameplay, characters you can connect with, and amazing visuals make it worth it to buy this masterpiece;expanded;English;10
Caiobrz;"If I were to describe Last of Us with one world, it would be ""hyped"". The story is good, but not awesome. The characters are good, but not awesome, the game is good, but not awesome. All that would lead to a solid 9/10 score, but things go down from there: gameplay is poor, the UI is clunky and simple actions like choosing a weapon require more buttons and actions than just using whatever you have, and the linear ""you can't ever side step"" nature of the story makes it more like an interactive game with moments of FPS than an atual game. People often rate Last of Us thinking only how great the story or characters are, but as a game it can't be considered that great.";normal;English;7
ahmed4pro;THE LAST OF US is  considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time not just to me but to the majority of the people who played it and experienced in such a way that no other video game can ever do . the game is flawless to be honest . [Gameplay /sounds/ graphics/ story/acting] all are perfect you just can't ask for more . especially the story which made every one who played it burst in tears .,the last of us is not just the best  post-apocalyptic game to be ever made. It the Best game of All time.;normal;English;10
User3;Naughty Dog were a good developer once who made good games like Crash Bandicoot. Since then their protaganists have all been boring dudes who look the same and have generic adventures.;expanded;English;0
Tito23;"Not only the best remastered game, but one of the best games in history. Naughty Dog doesn't know the meaning of failure. Here is my, try to be short, review on The Last of Us Remastered:,,I have to start with this game's strongest attribute. The story. My god, from the very beginning of putting you in tears to the end....practically hitting you in some more feels.This game rivals any great story of anything. Whether that be a book, movie, another game, whatever. I have never been so attached to two characters like Joel and Ellie. The relationship that starts off as a, ""I don't want anything to do with you"" and perfectly paces it to be like a father daughter relationship. You do not have to have your own kid to understand and see the love between the characters. From the get go, it hits you with something that you have never seen in a film or game. Right off the bat and in ways, even though this is another apocalyptic story, everything feels so new like you never have seen an apocalyptic story before.,,Gameplay. Gameplay is nothing revolutionary, but it most definitely done right and fits perfectly in this game's atmosphere. From the crafting to the scavenging and the ridiculous amounts of bricks and bottles to throw, it all feels right. I never got a thought of, wow.. this is retarded and not needed or even repetitive. The gameplay has the perfect flow, the perfect feel, and just done right in the right situations. I find the most interesting is the Clickers and different forms of the infected. They are not your typical, ""hey I am dead and want to eat you for no reason"" that we see nonstop from other games, movies, and shows alike.. They actually did some research and came up with a unique element that makes this whole end of world concept feel new. An actual disease. It is a fungal disease from ants that make them burst this fungus disease and make them eventually blind as well kills them. They develop a hostile nature and practically attacks everything they hear or feel. So to the storyline of the last of us, the disease grew and mutated and started effecting the human race.,,The cons of this game is that you will have to do something like punch a bear and get your manhood back. Because you will hit feelings you didn't know you had because us men are rock solid. But Naughty Dog brought a rock crusher so just be ready. I have no input on the multiplayer. Never played that part of the game, just the main and the story DLC, which is just as good even though 2 hours long. But hey, it is free so cant complain. But I have heard a lot of positive feedback on the multiplayer even though this is not a multiplayer focused game.,,All I can say is if you have not, buy and play this masterpiece. I don't know how Naughty Dog is going to top this with the Last of Us Part 2, but it will be hard and they are they people to just do that.";normal;English;10
ourtimehascome;"The Last of Us is the very definition of an overrated game. Its story is a blend of post-apocalyptic tropes and ideas that have been done a million times before. Throw in some zombies for good measure. Why not? It's already a cliche mess.,,A game like this gets praise for its attempts to be similar to a movie or even a novel. Then the gameplay cuts in and it's about helping the AI get to another area of the map. Repositioning ladders, opening doors, etc. That's the exploration aspect, which would have been fine if the gameplay wasn't so stifling. In actuality, it's a boring cover-shooter just like every other cover shooter. Except it's not innovative or unique. Apparently you can combine old ideas together and people will enjoy it.,,Then the ""stealth"" gameplay kicks in and it's just as bad. Throw bricks at enemies. Hey, it's more fun than moving ladders, but not by much.";normal;English;0
sultan09;The Last of Us, a game made by beautiful Artists and a brilliant storyteller!,,It's not just a video game, it's a film, it's a strong story that depicts humanity, emotion, sadness in a world that almost feels realistic.,,Awesome graphics, visually stunning, brilliant level designs, makes you wanna dive into that unpleasant world and find out more about the compelling characters.,,This title is a MUST PLAY, a MUST EXPERIENCE!;normal;English;10
JaySilver;"This game was sold as the promised land, but all I got was a pile of trash. I'm gonna keep this one short, because I already wasted to much time on it: The Story boring, Graphics are OK, Gameplay is thin and the ""crafting"" is a joke.

Skibz;After playing the last of us campaign a total of 3 times now I can honestly say the narrative in this game is the stand out. As a veteran video gamer you get used to games having disjointed immature storylines that you just play because the gameplay is alright. The last of us handles two things well relationships and the emotions that help create and maintain those relationships. The last of us is when video games grew up.;normal;English;10
badgerryan19;Wow! Maybe the greatest game ever made. From the characters of Joel and Ellie and the story that is truly emotional. Naughty Dog has once again struck gold again with this new and exciting franchise.;expanded;English;10
MADGAMER217;I'm going to be honest this game is good but not a full 10 out of 10 not only did naughty dog mess up with the enemy AI they did what they always do repeat the same thing over and over again, the game is so linear and you are doing the same thing over and over again until you go from point a to b. They do try and change it up by changing the map settings where you stealth but that is it. but that's mainly the only problem with the game the AI and the fact the levels feel repetitive even when you're travelling the you're doing the same thing. The story is fine it's been done before the characters are interesting and what shine through this game so thats a plus some moments in the game are crazy dissapointed there isn't a variety of zombies or whatever you want to call them the clickers were a good idea but thats it nothing else really shined out of the game but the crafting system the variety of weapons the fact that earlier in the game you were given more freedom on how to approach things the game is fine the stealth aspects are great the gameplay is great even though in every level you do samething there are great memorable moments playing the game and some good levels it's an ok game but really overrated mainly because that happens with exclusives they get overrated;normal;English;7
OneLifeLeft;Tense combat,,a gorgeous environment,,deeply poignant voice acting,,unrivaled facial design,,and a heartrending tale all breathe life into this extraordinarily unforgettable game.,,The characters of this story are narrated with such depth and vibrance, that it is impossible to see them as mere pixels on a television screen.,,Even years after having finished this game, I still remember the characters as though they were real people, I once knew.;normal;English;10

Tacticz;The Last of Us is my favorite game of all time. I loved Naughty Dog’s work with the Uncharted series, but I did not expect them to deliver a game this great. I cannot find a single flaw with this game. The story is one of the best I’ve ever experienced. Joel and Ellie are some of my favorite characters of all time now. The gameplay is amazing, especially when on harder difficulties where it actually feels like a survival game. And the multiplayer is also fantastic. It doesn’t feel tacked on, it feels like they took their time with it. The Last of Us is a masterpiece and one of the greatest games ever made.;normal;English;10
SuperDuck23;There is not one outstanding negative thing I can think of when I think about The Last of Us. Truthfully one of the greatest games ever made. Perfect gameplay, perfect writing, perfect performances, perfect game and sound design. Perfection down to the last pixel.;expanded;English;10
GamerJosh0137;I'm ashamed that it took me so long to play this game, especially considering how much I loved the Uncharted series.  Somehow this game ended up in my back log, but no more.  For me and what I look for in video games The Last of Us is as perfect of a game as I could ever hope to find.  You play as Joel.  A middle aged parent living in a quarantine zone in Boston.  I won't give too much away but Joel has a friend named Tess, and both are very good at smuggling.  It becomes quite apparent that what is left of the United States government is corrupt and loves censorship.  Anyway, it is really hard to give you much more than that without spoiling a lot.  It is not an open world game.  Instead it focuses on a more linear approach but at the same time rewards exploring players.  You will need supplies and ammunition both of which are very hard to find so make everything count.  I also suggest playing on hard your first run through.  Normal can be a bit too easy at times.  If you own a ps4 or ps3 pick this game up as soon as possible.  People will be talking about this game for years to come, and now that The Last of Us part 2 is in the works now is the perfect time to play it.;normal;English;10
spesini;The Last of Us is back, this time on PS4, and it's even better. I finished it five times on PS3, so when I got it again on PS4, mostly because I wanted to play awesome multiplayer without turning on the PS3, I thought that singleplayer can't surprise me anymore. But it did. 60 FPS is absolutely fabulous and the game is even better. Everything else stays the same, which means: perfect story, great gameplay and stealth, etc. (everything is great really).;normal;English;10
CapnConundrum;Honestly, anything other than a 10 for this game is completely insane.  This isn't even my favourite game.  But all the games I personally like better, I can see legitimate argument for something other than a perfect score.  This game pushes every boundary of the industry.  One day, many years from now, games will be nominated for Pulitzers and the like--will get accepted into mainstream critical culture.  If any game paves the way, it's The Last of Us.;normal;English;10

Calvoro;"The premise in The Last of Us is not exactly new or innovative. Post-apochalyptic setup, story about one person being the cure and hope for all mankind. It is not a new concept.,,However, this game is almost flawless on how the story is told, and how this setup is used, how the characters evolve and feel more engrosing the more you play. The fact this game delivers despite being a ""zombie-game"" so well is due to its amazing writing, voice acting, and compelling gameplay.,,Harder difficulties are true survival horror experiences that genre-fans should experience.,,If you are a fan of storytelling in videogames, this is a must buy game. It is not an ""interactive movie"" as many claim it to be, they simply haven't played the game. There are over 12 hours of gameplay without cutscenes. Also, this remastered edition includes the Left Behind DLC, which is a nice look into Ellie's story.";normal;English;10

theeDarkhorse;As a jaded gamer, Grounded mode on The last of us is a treat that comes around very rarely. A new experience. Its so polished an experience, they charged for it. I couldn't believe that at first but they've utterly justified it. Cannot fault it. I've completed it on hard and survivor (PS3) and it still feels fresh. They've programmed subtle randomness to the a.i and so i have not, and will not, master it. Perfect;normal;English;10

BlakDak666;The Last of Us Remastered is a amazing game that displays a stunning visual world and captivating story about internal and external conflicts over survival in a inhospitable world. The performances of Ashley Johnson as Ellie and Troy Baker as Joel is career defining, giving wonderful moments both in physical and emotional moments as one progresses in the game. The combat is fun and a test of skill, luck and stealth that makes engagements dire and FUBAR on harder modes. The strangling of enemies is kind of loud and admittedly the AI is not really that smart on some things, but these are easily glossed over by the power the game has at telling a story and telling it well. Usually perfection is something out of grasp in things (games no different), but the ending is the very rare diamond gaming moment that deserves to be called perfect and nothing less.,,The Remastered edition comes with the Left Behind DLC, which tells a story of Ellie's past mixed with her present day self in a thoughtful and well done way that deserves alot of praise. It also has a commentary that is fascinating to watch and the updated visuals and framerates make the experience of the story truly spectacular. The downside is the multiplayer..sort of. The inclusion of multiplayers in the Uncharted games have always been an issue with me because it was a means to compete with Microsoft's Gears of War  and as a player of both mps, Gears destroys Uncharted's mp. They just don't belong in the game (like they were tacked on) and just a way to get mp hungry players on its game, rather than enjoy its story and just that. The Last of Us has the strongest mp among the Uncharted series and contains its own meta game that is actually quite fun to play. Unfortunately,  the mp has microtransactions (even weapons you can purchase that could be pay-to win) and I cannot let that slide, no matter how good the game is.,,If it ditched it's multiplayer, then the Last of Us would easily be a 10/10 for me without even a moment's thought, but I cannot do it and so a 9/10 will do. This is to say nothing of the game's power and focus of its campaign and it is an absolute must to buy this game if you have not bought it already or just got a PS4.;normal;English;9

NinjaDave;What can I say that hasn't been said about The Last of Us. this truly is one the best games to come out in recent years and it seems everybody agrees. I got a PS3 just to play it and I was not disappointed and I did it again with the PS4 in 2014. As far as the story goes in a game, this was really the first time I actually cared about the story other than Telltales: The Walking Dead.,,While I only played and completed the game once on the PS3 version, The Last of Us remastered however, I beat this game 6 times and I'm planning on playing it again soon. Everything in this game has been done flawlessly. The story, music, graphics, gameplay and online are fantastic and I still play online to this day it is that good.,,This is a near perfect game. I have had no problem with the framerate and I've only encountered very minor glitches and glitches i have purposely preformed. with the game being so cheap you need to go out and buy a PS4 just to play this game if you haven't already.

ramsay356;Summary: One of the only games I consider a 10/10. An absolute masterpiece and best use of a video game to tell a story. A must play for any Naughty Dog fan.,,Full: After thinking long and hard about why this game was so effective and felt like a perfect experience, the answer is simply the word 'real'. The characters, the story, even the way enemies interact are the most realistic I have ever seen in a video game.,The gameplay aspect individually is completely engrossing, you get so caught up in the survival elements that you are compelled to scavenge as much as possible for anything you can craft with or, if you are lucky, a couple bullets. You develop a combination of stealth and shooter elements to handle enemies because its the only way to survive. The game makes you completely feel like you are in the characters shoes. Add in the classic Naughty Dog seamless cutscene integration to keep things fresh and the game flies by while you are glued to this world.,The story and characters are where this game really achieves something special. Escorting Ellie through enemy outposts and infected monsters can be fun, but if you can actually care about her survival the experience is nothing short of captivating. Your eyes open wide every cutscene where she falls down or where you get injured because you genuinely want the best for Joel and Ellie. Its hard to discuss the story much more without spoiling anything, but I doubt I will ever forget it.,In terms of the remaster itself, its hard to imagine it looking or playing any better than it does. Well worth the upgrade to those who owned it on PS3 and will want to play it again and a must buy for anyone yet to play it.,,Rating Justification: I can't fault The Last of Us for anything. It knows what it wants to do and what the experience should feel like and achieves it flawlessly. This is the only 10/10 game I have played in almost a decade. I originally bought my PS4 so that I could play the remaster when it came out, and it was worth every penny.;normal;English;10
Hemp316;Recently I bought A Playstation 4 and always wanted to play this Game since I heard all the hype and high praise of it.To be honest,I bought it new,put it on shelf and did not play it for A whole month.When I did eventually play it I have to say I was not that blown away.The first two or three hours were A bit of A grind and nothing that spectacular-basically just your standard Tutorial sections.,,It wasn't really until mid game where I really started to enjoy myself and I fell in A groove with it's mechanics.Speaking of which,this Game is heavily dependent on items and upgrading those items.This can be A lot of fun and encourages exploration.I was surprised there wasn't A lot of stealth aspects to the Game which is great since all I have ever seen in videos was those sections and often when I played them in the Game itself.,,The graphics are very well done and everything looks as natural and organic than any other Game I have ever seen before and the abandoned feeling rivals that of the Fallout series.The 'monsters' are nicely rendered and are scary and chilling.I think though to myself the scariest parts of this Game are the Human characters since they use strategy and effectively hunt you down as opposed to the Monsters that you can easily trick.,,The characters (without spoiling anything) are dynamic and are well thought out.You can tell A great amount of care and effort was given especially to these two characters as well as secondary characters.The dialogue sounds organic and realistic trying to copy something more closer to real life.At first these characters are people you could care less about.By the end,you are biting your nails with fear over some of the extreme situations you encounter because you care for each one of these characters.They grow through trials of hardship as certain events change their overall dynamic with one another.,,Ultimately,the end really satisfied me and made me become A convert to this series.I understood all the hype and praise and how it was justified.This wasn't A perfect Game though,the swimming was hard especially to dive.I didn't like the cover button as it was clumsy to use and didn't like what button was assigned to.I feel some weapons even when upgraded were virtually useless against Human opponents.The worst is the lack of ammo since as you pass by A lot of Military installations,There should at times should of been A small amount of stockpiles of ammunition.,,Other than these rather ultimately small gripes,this Games does gives you A lot for you money.It is A short Game and most of it is cut scenes,but when you finish all that the Game has to offer you will feel that you have experienced A great Game.If you want to play A well structured,thought out Game with care and balance to it then look no further than to The Last Of Us,You will never regret it.;normal;English;9

Everything is near perfect apart from the fact that the gameplay is a little uninspired, in particular the combat - this part of The Last Of Us isn't really anything special in my opinion. When playing Left behind (which I rate as a 10/10) the shortcomings of the main game become apparent - in LB Ellie has the possibility to get by human enemies by having her direct clickers onto them, which is a pretty good mechanic that enriches the combat gameplay by that little bit more... The main campaign of TLOU, however, misses this feature.,,Other than that I won't go much into why it is so good as you have already heard it somewhere else. This game is amazing.;normal;English;10

NateM2021;“The Last of Us” is a game developed by Naughty Dog Studios and was published by Sony Computer Entertainment in 2013. In this survival horror game, you play as the character named Joel. The plot of the story is how a zombie-like virus had taken over the world and not many  people are alive. The game is in third person, and has multiple features such as a “listening mode”. There is an online multiplayer mode for this game, but for this review I will only cover the story mode.,At the beginning of the virus, Joel and his daughter Sarah are trying to escape, but Sarah is shot and killed from an officer since he thought she was bitten. The game fast forwards years in the future and he goes to this group called the Fireflies and he and his friend Tess need to take a teenager named Ellie to a zone where another group will pick her up. Joel and Tess learn that Ellie had been bitten, but showed no symptoms and supposedly was the “cure” to the infection. The group has to keep moving to other places since things don’t usually work out they way they want to.,The game itself is very story driven, filled with intense cutscenes and heartwarming moments. It does a very excellent job of getting close to the characters, instead of most games where they are just space being taken up. You can during the story have some optional conversations with Ellie that might not impact the story, but can get yourself closer to the character. It breaks my heart whenever I see some close to death moments with the characters because they feel like family almost. The game is an emotional rollercoaster of emotions, going from upset to sad instantly. It was great to watch Joel and Ellie basically become father and daughter.,The gameplay and aesthetics look amazing in this game. There is a complex crafting system where you use materials you find around to make weapons like shivs and other things like health kits and barbed baseball bats. Look wise, just watching a simple cutscene can almost look like real life, and for one of the first few Playstation 4 games, the remaster is brilliant. Everything around you yells lonely apocalypse, but still holds its own beauty. Just looking at rusted cars with flowers and moss around just looks amazing. The different locations you go to all look extremely different, from a sewer to snowy woods. The sound track for me was pretty decent, not the best but still very enjoyable. My only real issue in the game was occasionally Ellie’s AI would make her shoot a gun in stealth.,For people that want to play this game, I would recommend being around 15 and up to play, since there are moments of extreme violence like when you die as Joel sometimes a clicker may rip your neck apart, or ripping your face apart. I would say it’s okay to play if you’re younger as long as you have an adult supervising you. This game sometimes goes extreme with things like burning, destruction of flesh, and even suicide.,Overall, this to me is a near perfect game, since of everything like aesthetics and gameplay, as well as plot development.;normal;English;10
TheQuietGamer;"The definitive version of the game, and not just because of it's upgraded graphics. This remastered version also includes extra DLC already on the disc, including the story chapter ""Left Behind."" So if you haven't played the game yet and have a PS4, this is the way to do so. Even if you've already played the game back on the PS3, the extra content and improved visuals are plenty of reasons to consider the upgrade.,,A word of warning though, while generally better looking all around, there are a few areas where the new graphics aren't up to snuff. The character models always look fantastic, but every now and then certain aspects of the environment can look dated. Most of the time though the game looks amazing. There are some really breathtaking moments. It's just that every now and then you'll come across something that makes you think ""Eh, this could look better."" I also encountered a few rare and very minor glitches here and there. Nothing serious though.,,Okay, so now that we've gotten the flaws out of the way (that was literally all of them), we can get into why the game is simply a don't miss experience. Naughty Dog pulled out all of the stops for this one and created one of the most stunning and incredible experiences gaming has to offer. The area where this is most notable is the narrative. Without spoiling too much, The Last of Us tells an emotionally gripping tale set in a fully realized world with some of the best writing and characters I've ever seen in a video game. The brutal, bleak nature of the game is handled marvelously. This is the perfect example of genuinely mature storytelling. The performances that bring these characters to life rival that of the best Hollywood actors. The writing's ability to resonate and effect me is on par with anything I've ever watched in a movie or read in a book. Simply put, the story is phenomenal.,,Given that this is a video game, storytelling alone isn't necessarily enough to give The Last of Us masterpiece status. It also needs to prove itself in the gameplay department. Something the game does strongly. The game does an excellent job of selling the feel of surviving in a world gone to crap. Ammo is scarce, you'll need to scrounge for supplies in order to get by, and crafting your own items is what will often get you by. Combat is savage and can pack quite the challenge. The exciting mix on tense third-person shootouts, brutal melee combat, and edge of your stealth options make it where it's your choice how you survive. Every bullet and item counts, especially on the higher difficulties. Fights require quick and smart thinking, whether you're fighting other well-armed survivors or the speedy infected. In order to fully upgrade Joel's abilities you'll need to playthrough more than once, which makes those new game + options all the more enticing.,,The Last of Us also has an enjoyable multiplayer component, that does a great job of making use of the story mode's mechanics in order to set it apart. You'll scavenge, craft, and use teamwork to win the day. There's also an interesting meta-game that has you winning supplies for the faction you pick. The better you perform and the more your camp will grow. As it does you'll be required to bring in more from your watches. It's an interesting loop that backs up the already strong core gameplay to keep you coming back.,,This game is nothing less than a masterpiece. One that's made even better on PS4 thanks to the included DLC and (mostly) improved visuals. It story stands as among the best gaming has to offer. The gameplay experience is so refined and fun that there's really no reason why anyone should pass this up. This is one of those rare, must-play games that only come around every once in a while and need to played when they do. It's even worth buying a PS4 or PS3 just to experience this game one way or another. If you have the option I recommend going for this PS4 version, as it gives you more of the experience.";normal;English;10
thryce3;Just replayed this recently and it's still a masterpiece.  The story and the game play work together in a way every other game should aspire to.  It is easily one of the best narrative experiences I have ever had in any media.  Truly an outstanding achievement in gaming.;expanded;English;10
HashZ21;My first experience with this game was the remastered edition on the PS4 and for quite some time it was the most visually stunning game on the console. This game does so many things right that I feel that some of it's faults are easily overlooked. The Game play itself is tense and tight. Every bullet counts, each shiv is important and medication is scare even on the normal difficulty. The horror of this game is based in the horror of man and the suspense of wading through a clicker filled room not knowing if you'll make it through alive. But by far the most important thing in this game is the story. Now I have to admit the story isn't original, but it is well told. The characters are real and the dialogue believable. The lack of clear villains means each side is seen as human as people trying to make the best of a bad situation, but the game doesn't forget to have some fun, make some jokes and enjoy life. The voice acting and facial animation must be commended as being amazing. Overall this game is an experience with enough challenge to attract people for a multiple playthroughs.;normal;English;10

Leo_Manzano;The Last Of Us is undoubtedly one of the best games released in the generation of Ps3 in case you did not have the opportunity to play this wonder worth knowing if it has already played worth taking time to play again.,,The game takes place in a post apocalyptic future where the world was taken over by a fungus that turns people into zombies and drove society to collapse, in this world we will accompany Joel a middle-aged man already hopeless of a better future that must lead Ellie A child who has in his blood the possibility of healing for the zombie plague for the fireflies a group that seeks to find a way to end the plague.,,The mechanics of the game boils down to three things: combat, stealth, and join resources that prove to be the hardest part of the game lack of features that makes you think its times before you shoot or engage in combat. But what makes The Last Of Us such a unique experience and its story and how Naughty Dog manages to build characters who can influence people's feelings by making a player really care about the characters in the plot.,,The Last Of Us has shown to the gaming industry that good characters can turn a cliché story when well told and with charisma of the characters can become a unique experience.;normal;English;10
DylanJHamilton;The Last of Us was a masterpiece in 2013 and with this release in 2014, you get all of the goodies leftover from Naughty Dog with enhanced graphic and interaction. The FPS is absolutely amazing with the known concept of apocalyptic doom in which is an absolute masterpiece! The composition of the game is simply astonishing and groundbreaking. Gameplay never changed but enhanced as said before. The story is heartbreaking in which it gives you a hard GRIP of reality if there were an apocalypse. The concept of what caused this apocalypse in this story in which gives nobody any hope is absolutely what everyone looked for in a survival horror. I say this is THE best survival horror shooter EVER MADE in HISTORY. Beating out Left 4 Dead and Resident Evil 4 etc. This game is groundbreaking, beautiful and realistic. The characters are absolutely realistic and it gets rid of the rhetoric of question in women in video gaming as you take over as Ellie in the second to last level. Joel is an absolute example of a man who has lost everything who had to fight to get back everything he had. This journey changed him as well as it did in Ellie.,,This also comes with the DLC Left Behind where you take over as Ellie. This is enhanced as well and also amazing as it ties with the story. It also brings in diversity and understanding. People will be mad at some of Ellie's incapabilities but you have to understand the reality of a young girl trying to survive in a situation such as the DLC and the second to last Chapter in the game. There is serious potential in the future for a more powerful Ellie as a playable character bringing in the diversity for those who desire it.,,You are getting a full experience for an emotional and realistic journey in post apocalyptic America in The Last Of Us: Remastered. You will not regret getting this copy!;normal;English;10

winterbox;"I held off on the Last of Us as I did not have a PS3. Recently I purchased the PS4 slim and got this game as a gift. I heard a lot about it and how amazing the story is. Before playing this I also played NaughtyDog's ""Uncharted 4"". As a remastered version The Last Of Us had pretty good graphics, albeit the character models, movements, acting and general world graphics still felt a bit out dated compared to Uncharted 4. However, this would be a very unfair comparison. Regardless, I really enjoyed the game play, combat, crafting, voice acting, the grimness, the intensity of the puzzles and sneaking around.,,Overall I do recommend this game. My only gripe is that, though I understand why the ending is powerful and how it can certainly raise some hairs on your necks, the execution and choice of words felt rushed and it did not blow me away. I think my expectations were too high.";normal;English;8

EspadaTiburon;I played this game for the first time recently despite having a PS3. Never saw what the hype around this game was about and I never liked the Uncharted series, so Naughty Dog making it meant nothing to me. I finally gave it a try and sort of regret not playing it sooner. The game is fantastic. The story does a very good job of instilling emotion into the player and it's paced very well. To be honest, the game felt really short to me when I look at the time that I spent playing it. However, the pacing of the story and everything felt just right. Nothing felt rushed or dragged on. Length wise, I felt it was short, but I enjoyed every moment of it and really wouldn't change anything about the writing. This game is a masterpiece in terms of the story. The game is looks great and it's one of the best remasters of a last generation game. It runs great as well, unlike many other remasters that are quick cash grabs. The content definitely justifies the price of it. My only issue with this game is the combat and general gameplay of it. The combat is really nothing special. I found it sometimes a bit boring, to be honest. It's extremely solid, but does nothing really new and I felt it was just good, but nothing to write home about. The gameplay was definitely not clunky or had any massive flaws. Another issue I had was how annoying it would be with how you had to be in a exact spot. I remember during the game, going underwater to get a wooden raft. When I got close to it, it wouldn't let me interact with it. I had to get at a perfect distance from it in order to interact with it. This was really annoying because the interaction button only appeared for a second as I was swimming around and I almost missed it. This would lead me to just wander around randomly trying to figure out what to do to progress in the game. Aside from this issue, this game is definitely perfect. Would recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried the game before. I wasn't really sure what the hype was about before, but I can definitely see it now. It's worth all the praise and hype around it.;normal;English;9

AceSeptre515;"I never wrote a review for this game, and with the recent announcement of The Last of Us Part 2, I went back for a replay to see how well the game stood the test of time being as the game is now three and a half years old. If I had to use one word to some up The Last of Us, that word would be Emotion. Naughty Dog has created a world so believable, so immersive, and absolutely frightening which is a feat unto itself. But its the characters that really make The Last of Us stand out as a true masterpiece of game design. It's not very often that you can connect with the characters of a video game on such a deep and interpersonal way. You feel deeply for the plight of Joel and Ellie. You understand the moral dilemma that they face in a way that even film producers have a hard time getting their audience to emotionalize. The perfect design of the post apocalyptic United States, paired with who in my opinion are the two greatest characters to ever be voiced in a video game along with a soundtrack that can bring tears to your eyes all on its own, and you really start to understand that Naughty Dog has done something special with The Last of Us. Since the original release on PS3 in July 2013 I have played completely through the game twelve times and it never once ceases to amaze. I still cry every time even though I know exactly what is going to happen. I still feel lost in the landscape despite the fact I know exactly where I am going. Another thing I think is absolutely worth mentioning about this game is that despite some very tense moments, you never feel pressured to perform. You don't have to play the game ""perfectly"", you don't have to master some inane set of skills to help you progress. All you have to do is sit back and play. I like to play the game at night in the darkest room in the house and just sit back and relax and allow myself to be complete transported into the world. If you are tired of first person shooters, tired of RPGs and overly gratuitous action in every video game you play then The Last of Us is worth every last bit of your time and money. If I had to make a list of three video games that were the only games I could play for the rest of my life, then The Last of Us would be near the top. Even if you only every play FPS games. Even if you only play JRPGs, heck...even if you only play card games, I suggest you play The Last of Us. Then, play it again.";normal;English;10

lizardking420;post patch 1.08 i started playing this game again after this patch and after they announced part II. looks like they censored the game. For instance heads no longer explode in many ways via hand to hand, or for the other each different animations that or so much less frequency I can't see it. I recorded my second play through on youtube this august and can see the differences. I don't like any of the changes and It's no longer perfect. it's ike a sick money grab from sony for the next one.,original review august rated 10- This game is so good. My nose bled playing it again. While it's not a perfect game due to glitches, poor ai based off squad tactics, enemies with infinite ammo and repeative ai. it's still the most intense single played game i ever played. The graphics are hard to see but their highly detailed , they put out almost everything in singleplayer. I never really enjoyed the running game but playing it on grounded and survival hand to hand combat opened up into a street brawler i never knew about. I died so many times stoned and drunk i can't really remember the story it get's far fetched. If they make another i hope ellie grows some **** and starts acting like a babe. I want to play as myself not an old man, nothing in game would change. The music and sound is unreal it captures the atmosphere perfect.;normal;English;10

keanex;"I remember when I used to subscribe to Game Informer they had talked about The Last of Us and before it even came out I had humongous expectations for it. I never wound up buying a Playstation 3 due to time and such, but I always wanted to after hearing just how phenomenal people thought it was.,,So I'm killing time in a Best Buy after going to the dentist before heading to work and I was browsing the Sony aisle. I asked if they had any deals on the Playstation 3, the first guy said no and that was about all he said. So another guy who works there overheard me and said that they were running a special on the PS4 today, he put Ratchet and Clank in my hand first, which I was thinking, ""Oh cool, I heard it's good."" Then he put The Last of Us Remastered in my hand and I had NO idea they remastered it - I haven't really played many video games in years. He told me they were both included today with the PS4.,,I grabbed that PS4 immediately and drove home to play The Last of Us. I beat it two days later. One of the best games I've ever played and even if I never played another PS4 game that would have been almost worth it for that alone. Heck that game exceeded all hype.,,As for the game itself, survival horror similar to Resident Evil with a phenomenal story that gripped me and never let go. This game is brilliant and a must own.";normal;English;10
Dominix99;It's hard to find anything wrong with this game. My only complaint is that the stealth system is a little wonky but other than that, this is a perfect game.

Odogreviews;I got the Last of Us around the time it came out but never managed to find the time to finish it. The game has amassed many accolades and awards from critics and is considered one of the greatest games of all time. I was finally able to find the time to finish it. The Last of Us even still in 2016 is one of the best PlayStation exclusives I have ever played. The Last of Us is an action survival game developed by Naughty Dog well know for the Uncharted series. Hearing that the game took place in a post-apocalyptic zombie setting my hopes went down. The post-apocalyptic zombie genre is beginning to get real stale and old. People have compared this game to the Walking Dead TV series that  I have no inclination in watching. For this review I will try to push aside all my views on the genre and focus instead on the game and explain why I am able to like this game but still not like the genre it is in.,The Last of Us was made a few years ago back in 2013 at the end of 7th console generation. I will be reviewing the remastered version on PS4 which looks surprisingly beautiful and breathtaking for a post-apocalyptic setting. Instead of creating a generic desert wasteland setting the Last of Us features a variety of unique environments from collapsed cities and suburbs where plants and nature are returning to flourish, stunning mountains full of trees rivers and wildlife to snowy locations up in the mountains. The graphics have also aged surprisingly well but do not look as impressive as some of the current 8th generation game engines. How well the graphics have held up his a testament to the fact that photo-realistic graphics can be just as stunning if not better than stylized ones.The game features limited types of enemies which include infected zombies and bandits and raiders and the occasional soldiers. I found the infected design better than most zombie designs because of the fact that they are infected by a fungal infection based off of the real life fungal infection that happens to insects called cordyceps. I found the zombie enemies still unexciting and uninspired and I felt they could have done more with the fungal infection theme. I find zombies a repetitive uninspired enemies that are too prevalent in the game industry. I found the raider encounters tense and exciting especially the encounters in the winter section of the game. Overall the Last of Us offers an impressive presentation that will not be forgotten excusing the boring zombie enemies.,Story wise the Last of Us tells an unforgettable story that  you will not forget. I found the story so enjoyable that I recommend playing this game for the story alone. The Last of Us stars the main characters of Joel and Ellie. I found them some of the most well developed characters in a video game period. I don’t want to spoil the story at all because it is that good. All I will say is that the game takes place during the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse in the U.S. The goal is to escort Ellie a 13 year old girl who is immune to the virus to the lab of the Fireflies a terrorist organization that fights against the now remaining U.S. government which has become militarized. The story will keep you on edge as you watch Ellie and Joel travel across the country trying to survive. By the end of the game you will gripping your controlling hoping that Ellie and Joel can make it out alive. My favorite character by far is Ellie and I found her to be entertaining, sympathetic, and funny all at the same time. I found the ending satisfying and encompasses the tone of the game.,The Last of Us offers fun innovative gameplay that helps add to game's narrative and graphics. The Last of Us uses the standard survival gameplay system. The game uses stealth and a crafting system where combat is done with an over the shoulder perspective. The game also has the occasional boss fights as well. The gameplay is nothing to write home about yet its simplicity is its beauty. The gameplay allows the player to experience the story and atmosphere without being interrupted. I found the melee combat nice and crunchy and allows the player to feel every painful brutal attack you give to each enemy. The gameplay adds to brutal nature of the story by having the player engage in guerilla warfare by having the player use handcrafted weapons and basic firearms. I did find some weapons unnecessary such as the flamethrower and automatic weapons. They take away from the survival nature of the combat and turn it into a generic over the shoulder shooter like most games. The Last of Us delivers in making tense survival gameplay that will keep entertained throughout the game.,,The Last of Us is an essential game that should be played by all Playstation users. The game features atmospheric realistic environments and crafts a story that is so excellent it will be remembered long after finishing the game. The survival gameplay is great but does not quite measure up to the game’s story and atmosphere. I believe that there will never be such a thing as a perfect game but the Last of Us comes extremely close. The game has a few flaws such as the long load times and zombie enemies which I found simplistic compared to the game’s great story and characters. Despite the fact that I do not like the zombie apocalypse genre, I found that The Last of Us a masterpiece. When I finished the game and saw the credits roll I realized that the game was not about the zombies but the human drama instead and what people will do to protect the ones they love.,,10/10: Masterpiece;normal;English;10
Jamesshen;Well, how do i start. The last of us remastered is one of the few good games i ever played in PS4. It shock factor is quite entertaining and we get to learn on how to make good use of our ammos, learn about enemy movements and many others. Characters was quite interesting. The only thing that i disliked was that some of the rooms are actually very dark and im having difficulties seeing through the enemies.

That is the only issue that I had. If you are interested in Graphics & Story then its a must buy game.;normal;English;10

What do you fight for when all is lost? where do you go when there is no where safe to go?,,The last of us remastered is an excellent survival horror game that is set in Boston. The game takes the main two protagonist Joel and Ellie across the United States to find a cure to a fungal disease that has crippled the entire U.S. population and have turned them into zombies. This is a game I could easily recommend to anyone looking to play a good game with an amazing story. I found that the game developers did a great job on the games fully fleshed out main protagonists and their relationship as the story progresses. The music choice is yet another great feature, along with the great art style. Overall this game is still an amazing game and I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great story and for a bit of a scare.";normal;English;9
HTGamer;"The Last of Us is one of the greatest games ever made. It's that simple. Unlike other great games that have aged badly, The Last of Us is still highly enjoyable to play today, more than 3 years after it originally came out on PS3.,,The story is about Joel and teenager Ellie, who embark on a personal journey. This isn't about some cliche' marines single-handedly saving the world without a sweat, it's about ordinary people trying to survive another day in a post-apocalyptic world, 20 years after an infection ravaged the world. Across their journey they will face many obstacles and challenges, along with other characters, both benevolent and malevolent. Enemies are both humans and zombies (""infected""). The story is beautiful and personal, and culminates in one of the best ending dialogues in gaming history. You 'll also enjoy little details like Ellie trying to learn how to whistle, wondering about the world before the apocalypse (she sees a fashion ad and says ""why girls were so skinny back then?""), or telling silly jokes to Joel by reading her joke book.,,Also included in the game is the DLC Left Behind, which is a prequel to the main game's story. It's not just a small dose of the Last of Us, it's somewhat different, as it is more story-focused and light-hearted fun, and action takes a back seat. Since Ellie hasn't many guns and is weak physically, she has to either avoid enemies (humans and zombies) or make them battle between themselves. To help play through, it is mixed with a bit of gameplay and story from the main game, meaning that Left Behind is a memory of Ellie. But it is strongly advised that Left Behind should be played AFTER completing the main game.,,Gameplay is great. The game is about survival and resource management, because these are scarce in a post-apocalyptic world. You have just a few bullets, and there are a few collectibles to pick up and craft items such as healing packs and molotov cocktails, which can be done at any moment. The game is linear in its structure, but most of the levels are open enough to take advantage of multiple routes, multiple levels, or distracting enemies by throwing bottles. There are also the occasional puzzles, but nothing too difficult.,,The multiplayer suite included is fantastic and original. It's slower paced, like the main game, and you have to take down enemies while hiding, making no noise (because by running you are detected more easily), and collecting resources for your virtual clan. There is a variety of maps and modes, but the main point is to just survive through to the end of 2 campaigns, by completing missions (or rather challenges).,,Graphics are beautiful in an artistic sense, but not great technologically, since the game was originally developed for the PS3. The remaster work by Naughty Dog cleans up the image and doubles the frame rate to 60 fps, but the game is still a previous-gen one. Sound-wise, both the voice acting and the minimalist but haunting soundtrack are great.,,All in all, no gamer should overlook The Last of Us. It's a must buy. And a true classic.";normal;English;10

blakfayt;"The Last of Us is, quite honestly, an 8/10. Most people go on and on about the story and how touching it was, how much they felt, and the story is actually the weakest part of the game. TLoU tells the story of a cliche single father whose daughter predictably dies inside of ten minutes without the player really knowing either of them, and we're supposed to care because she was his daughter. He then finds a replacement daughter 20 years later and that's about it. Naughty Dog themselves even said the entire game was built around Joel and Ellie's father/daughter relationship. And that was a stupid decision.,,The game, at certain points, suggests two VASTLY MORE INTERESTING stories, Joel's life in the post apocalypse as a smuggler, and his adventures with his brother shortly after the outbreak. Instead we get a typical ""Father tries to connect with his step daughter on a road trip"" Hollywood story, told in a kind of dark setting. The few times we actually do something other than be cliche are far apart and don't last long. The ending is also very predictable and didn't surprise me in the slightest.,,Where the game really shines is in combat. Shooting things is good, the stealth is difficult but rewarding (and infuriating, but we'll get to that), overall it flows very well. The mixed gameplay is fun to mess around with, and I'm a total sucker for exploration that gives me upgrades, and crafting. There's enough variety for each player to make their own style in combat. Personally, I got addicted to throwing smoke bombs after kiting enemies into one area and then molotoving them and shotgunning the stragglers.,,There are faults in the system, however. There are enemies that kill you instantly that are very difficult to distinguish from a distance from ... literally any other enemy. You have to either stealth kill these guys, or spend quite a few bullets (in the early game) to take them out. This leads to incredibly frustrating areas where two or more are in close proximity, and since they use sound instead of sight, sneaking up on two in the same room is nigh impossible without serious shenanigans. The game also drops the ""ammo is scarce! Use it wisely!"" around the middle of the game unless you're playing on one of the much harder difficulties. Naughty Dog, again, have explicitly stated that TLoU uses some kind of ammo counter, and while you won't get every shot back after a fight, the enemies are programmed to drop enough for survival in the next area, which is generally more than enough. I cleared the game my first time through with more handgun rounds than I could use in a single fight. They also obnoxiously lock simple minded ""skills"" behind high walls. One of the most useful skills you can purchase allows you to save yourself if grabbed by a zombie by stabbing them. I don't know about you, but I don't need training on how to shove a sharp object into something that's trying to strangle me. It seems quite obvious really, and only serves to hide the more useful ability behind it on the upgrade tree.,,Despite those few flaws, the game is quite enjoyable. The story is fun enough the first time through, if predictable, and the voice acting really makes the characters pop. The graphics are good, though I wish we could have seen more of cities coated in mushrooms growing everywhere, give us the sense that the fungus was taking over. But most importantly, shooting guys is fun. Sneaking up on them is challenging but fun. Those are the most important things. The game is FUN to play. Too many people get hung up on the story and completely miss that the controls are smooth easy to understand, combat is challenging but rewarding, and the systems incorporated in the game make exploration worth doing. If there's one thing I hope for in The Last of Us 2 I hope they make the environments bigger and give us more things to craft and upgrade. But, maybe make the skill upgrades something that would need upgraded instead of simple self defense that a child could do.";normal;English;8

Bravo_blackadde;My first 10, I completed the original on normal difficulty on the ps3 and wondered if there would be any point getting it again. Thanks to the stunning graphics and all new grounded mode I was not disappointed.,If you hate dying and often rage quit this difficulty isn't for you. I had to completely alter my playstyle, fearing every corner, constantly checking for every bit of ammo and without the OP listen mode it makes for a much much more tense experience. The infected became a huge threat and I had to plan my approach carefully to get though each chapter. Of course if your just playing for story then grounded mode isn't for you but I fully recommend sticking with it for a bit too see if your up the challenge !

MercenaryofHate;This game is art.  Everything from the graphics to the gameplay feel top notch and is unfortunately a rare experience in these current times. Let me start with the story, It is rich and exotic the characters actually feel alive and everything they do to what they think can be a serious note. In this game you are the remnants of a large virus epidemic that turns people into flesh eating zombie-like monsters. If i were to use a TV show for this comparison i would say The Walking Dead! The plot is great with some twist and turns oh and if you don't do that QTE expect a gory scene to come from there after thanks to the graphics engine the game is able to express the devastation and detail of life after civilization collapsed. This game just gets everything right so anyway anyone tries to use the outbreak for their own gain is demonstrated and most of the time gives you the option to play the hero. The gameplay however is different then almost any game think of it as Dark Soul's difficulty compared to an FPS it is that good. Due to supplies being scarce it is up to you to find ammo and weapons and use them at appropriate times or face an unfortunate end. You are always in constant danger from infected and from hostile human beings. The third person view seems most appropriate and gives it an Uncharted like style with out the Uncharted feel.  The game mixes lots of emotions it could get very dark at times, funny or just plain depressing but that is why you play it and it feels true to it's name in addition the games price currently is excellent The Last of Us constantly won game of the year and it is deserving of it %100. Sony has delivered one of PlayStation's most famous games and I hope to see more great experiences from Naughty Dog.;normal;English;10
fijiboy;this is probably the best game of the last generation, and the remaster is the best version of it. when it comes to its storytelling, it has many similarities to the uncharted games, but with a much darker tone and even better writing. there is not a single moment wasted in this game, not a single time I was not immensely invested in the gameplay, story and the characters. no other game has ever had me as captivated as this game. It is full of moments in gameplay and cut scenes that I will always remember and always resonate with me, wether it be moments of extreme sorrow, horror, joy, tension, or anger. this one of the most well crafted narratives ever made, if not the most. what really brings this game home for me though is how its gameplay is equally enthralling, always tense and surprisingly engaging and deeper than the surface would suggest, I couldn't find a single flaw in the game, perhaps for a few nitpicks with how certain gameplay moments such as using a plank to bring Elli across water gets used a few times but that's really reaching. Naughty dog has made a name for itself as possibly the best game developers working today.;normal;English;10
Tagirix;The Last of Us Remastered was one of the first games I've ever played on PS4. It was recommended by a friend of mine. Unfortunately, at first time I didn't understand how great the game was, but after playing a few hours I realized how wrong I was. You will take control of two characters who attempt to survive in a postapocalypse world. It's everything you need to know about story. Ah, also, they are like a father and a daughter, but it is not true. The gameplay is pretty interesting for discussing. It's not an interactive movie, as some people consider. It's an usual game, but it's so cinematic, right. The dialogues were just awesome, no words needed for describing it. I can't stop saying that TLoU has pretty well-sounding soundtrack, graphics, etc. Frankly speaking, I consider that The Last of Us is the main exclusive Sony has got. Seriously. The Order is pretty good, Untill Dawn is great too, but this one will make you buy the console. Only this game, as I think. In a nutshell, it is a masterpiece.;normal;English;10

And honestly, I didn't care about any of the characters in the end. The AI got dumbed down since the E3 gameplay. It would make sense for that to happen with the PS3. But with the PS4 the AI could have been even smarter than the one in E3. But this ""Remaster"" offers nothing but slighty improved graphics and 60fps.

mosannam9696;I had a strong itch to replay this after playing Uncharted 4 and it blew me away all over again. I see a lot of complaints and low scores for this game stem from them saying the gameplay is bad and that's one of the most untrue statements I've ever heard for a video game. That's fine if they didn't like it, but that just means it isn't for them. The stealth is some of the best I've seen and the crafting and level up system just works so well. Then you get to survivor mode and grounded mode and that's when the real fun starts. The entire time I truly feel like I'm in these character's shoes and it's exhilarating.;normal;English;10
Darth_Kane;Okay, I have to admit, this game was one of the reasons that I bought a PS4 after my 360. This is how video games should be, and it's a shame that so few studios can deliver a story like this (other examples for me: Half Life 2, Bioshock). I definitely recommend this game for anyone, and I really hope that ND will keep making many-many games like this for years to come.;expanded;English;10

Rocketman64;The Last of Us is a story driven game that never really passed my radar and I did not notice at all. After everyone started calling it the greatest game ever I was naturally disposed to dislike it as it looked like a cliche zombie game mixed with a cliche cover shooter, that would be barely interactive. So when I played it I was surprised to discover that it was actually a spectacular must experience game. The Last of Us has a cliche story. The Last of Us has game play you've seen before.

sollc;Quick summary, The last of us is my first ever Naughty dog game and oh boy, it is probably the best game I have ever played in a very long time. The story is nothing special, it's your typical zombie infection, apocalypse. What made the game stand out are the characters and the character development. The relationship between Joel and Ellie is just outstanding. The gameplay is fluid and thanks to the 60fps, The visual design were amazing. My only flaw with the game is the A.I. They were on and off throughout the game. Some of the positives of the A.I was that: they would flank you, they will take cover, They paid attention to how much bullets you had left but they were blind. They were completely clueless of ellie. Overall the game is a masterpiece despites it's technicals flaws.;normal;English;10

TixyLix;"I cannot say I had much fun playing The Last of Us, but the amazing level design and story is what kept me playing through. It's a bad game, but a good experience, overall its managed to still be propped up by that, but I'd never want to play through it again.,,The character movement is very stiff, a lot of the times you're left wondering why you cannot jump up places or squeeze through gaps. So most of the gameplay revolves around finding alternative routes, usually by finding a wooden pallet for Ellie, giving a boost up or finding a ladder. It really becomes tiresome, especially since you can see a big gap in the object that has fallen over, that for some reason the game decides would be impossible to get through.,,I just found myself through all the Infected and shooting scenes, just saying to myself ""alright we'll just get past this to get to the story"". I never wanted to do the shooting or the stealth, the combat isn't good and the controls are too stiff for stealth. Hitman makes stealth fun and Gears of War makes shooting fun, but The Last of Us is neither. I never actually enjoyed the gameplay part of the game, my favourite parts were the down time, the moments I was exploring and finding cool random things in the world. What's good is the DLC is pretty much 80% of this, why I enjoyed playing the DLC more than the actual main game.,,I would love to see The Last of Us 2, maybe telling the story of the downfall as the opening part of the game was the best part of The Last of Us. I just think The Last of Us is good, just nothing amazing.";normal;English;7

Colaflare;The attention to detail and the care the actors took to portray the real grit of the game was astounding. This game is miles above its competition. It's one of the very few games that has earned its respect. Understandably the hype has caused some to hate on the game or has clouded their sense of fulfilment in the game (coming after the hype means that you're actively scanning for flaws rather than enjoying the experience). This game does not need you to read this review, it is undeniably a masterpiece. The crafting together of complex subtleties in narrative alone would warrant it praise... The Remastered version is far better.;normal;English;10
dylan_duckett;"What I liked the most about this game was the originality of it. The ‘zombies’ in The Last of Us are very different than ones I’ve seen in other games. The ideas for the ""upgraded"" clickers and bloaters is absolutely amazing and very creative. These kind of creative additions to the already loved zombie franchise are what make The Last of Us such an incredible game.,Along with the amazing creativity comes an amazing game-play. The entire game kept my attention and was really hard to put down due to all of the events that are constantly unraveling. There’s a very comfortable balance of emotionally damaging moments, most of which come from Ellie and Joel’s father-daughter relationship developing and progressing, and action-filled fighting sequences. Speaking of fighting sequences, I loved the parts where you got to fight non-infected people. The amount of thought into each and every character, even the guards or assassins that you only see once before you kill them, is absolutely insane and makes the game one hundred times more addictive. Characters can be tricky to develop correctly, especially in video games, but the creators of The Last of Us nailed each and every character completely.,Overall, the game-play was amazing and intense with hardly any boring moments and was able to keep me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Not knowing what was going to pop out at me every five seconds was a very fun experience. The story line was impeccable, the graphics were nothing less than exquisite, and the originality was definitely there. I would, without a doubt, rate this game ten zombies out of ten and would encourage anyone who enjoys killing things and being emotionally traumatized, in a good way of course, to play this game.";normal;English;10

chillaxer;The single-player game is somewhat overrated. The story is good, but too much of the game-play is just plain boring. Half the time you’re either locating an object to move from point A to point B or just exploring every nook and cranny of a building looking for supplies. However, the multi-player is SUPERB, the general idea is that it emphasizes team play rather than your usual COD style run n’ gun. You seriously have to play 500+ matches before you feel like a “good” player.  All in all, TLOU Remastered is a must buy for any PS4 owner.;normal;English;9

Jimi360;I did not get the chance to play The Last of Us on PS3, so when the remaster came out on the PS4 (albeit very soon after its PS3 release... £££) I was very eager to play the game. Though it didn't reach the 'best game ever' status that a lot of people have given it, it is a very, very good game.,,The soundtrack is immense and memorable, the graphics are hugely improved from what were already incredible graphics on the PS3, as Joel and Ellie become instantly relateable thanks to their realistic look, as well as some of the best voice acting you will hear in video games. Naughty Dog never disappoints when it comes to that aspect of games. The story of the game is so realistic it will invest anyone who plays it, the fact that the bacteria and disease involved is a real thing that does not effect humans at the moment does make the player wonder, could this actually happen?,,On the other hand, the gameplay does disrupt The Last of Us in my opinion. You will go from shooting humans that they put in front of you, to sneaking through a pack of clickers, to trying to escape from something, rinse and repeat and rinse and repeat. There is never huge variation in the gameplay, and with the shooting being particularly slow, it does not help the game at all. The Last of Us suffers from the same problems I felt Uncharted suffered from, in such a beautiful world there is never any room for exploration. Couldn't you just let us wander just a little? Damn you Naughty Dog.,,Multiplayer is quite gripping, however it doesn't really keep up with what the story was about, but it is entertaining none the less. The Last of Us is a very, very good game that does a lot of things right, but, in my opinion, just falls short of the 'great' tag.;normal;English;8
inthecrease31;Amazing game!  One of my favorite games of all time.  I rarely play a game again after beating it, but I played this game three times.  There isn't much more to say that hasn't been said already.   If you haven't played TLOU, don't wait a minute longer!  Do yourself a favour and play it on Hard right from the start.  It is way too easy on lower difficulty settings (you get way too much ammo and supplies).  It might get frustrating in the beginning, but once you learn the controls it is a lot more satisfying to play on a harder difficulty.,,Pros,+ Graphics are beautiful,+ Gameplay is perfect,+ Story is fantastic,,Cons,+ Very easy to beat on Easy and Normal difficulty;normal;English;10

rokit90;"I was lucky enough not to experience this on the PS3, after playing the uncharted series 1-3 consecutively about 8 times playing on every difficulty, I skipped out on this naughty dog project.

fluxmulder;"Let's not pretend this is an innovative and groundbreaking game, because its not. TLOU is your basic Walking Dead episode made into a game. You got your clickers (zombies), post-apocalyptic America, the last remnants of humanity fighting for survival, and all the ""tough"" and ""gut wrenching"" situations and story beats that you'd expect from this genre. You play generic gruff white guy Joel, and the intolerably precocious Ellie. ND claims that wanted to break molds with the characters, but at the end of the day, you're playing yet another white guy, protecting a damsel in distress. The gameplay: it sucks. This is not a fun game. Very clumsy 3rd person shooter with lots of realism mechanics thrown in, like staggering when you get hit, limited ammo, and spastic enemy animations that make it hard to hit them. There's some lazy stealth thrown in, which consists of you shuffling around cover and being told you are hidden, even though the top of your head is clearly visible to the AI. There's some crafting and a small skill tree thrown into the mix, but they don't add much. Other games have done it before, and in a more fun way. This game was one huge chunk of Oscar-bait. Everything about it screams ""look at us, we're so thought provoking and serious"". It feels forced and unnatural, like they want their game to be considered art. Along the way, they forgot that they were making a game, which is supposed to be fun. As such, as a game, TLOU is a complete failure.";normal;English;5
jakeman25;Easily one of the best games I have ever played, the story is fantastic, emotional, and gut-wrenching. The world believably scary, and extremely tense. I'll never forget the first time I heard a clicker. Games usually don't bring tears to my eyes, but The Last of Us did in the first 20 minutes. The multiplayer brings what was good in the single-player, tense battles where team work is a must. Beautiful game and one to have in your collection if you don't already. 10/10;normal;English;10
Lycria;Wow The Last of Us is a game that make you feel emotions that you didn't even think possible. Kidding of course but it is a very touching game that will tug at your heart strings. It starts off early by letting you know just what you are in for.,,I never played the original for PS3, so I am not sure on the comparison for the graphics but this is a great looking game. There are a few small complaints as to why doesn't the bushes or grass even budge when interacting with them, but it doesn't take away from the great overall scenery.,,The character development is fantastic, showing both Joel And Ellie feeling a great range of emotions both about the situation and their pasts. Naughty Dog sets up a great world for this to set up, with not as much as I would of liked for exploration as most areas are pretty liner but I guess that why games like Day Z exist. Both the interactions with the infected and humans feel intense. There was a section of the game where I wont go too much into detail not to spoil it, but I had sneaked around all the infected to come to a door that was blocked. You had to move the object which made a lot of noise attracting the whole room and got my heart racing. I had no idea if I was going to make it out of the room or not. This game is filled with these moments, and also filled with moments where you and Ellie are out in a field and talk about something. The game does a great job in building both characters up.,,Also this game comes with the Left Behind DLC, which is a great addition as both a prequel and some information that happens during the main game.,,The only other complaint I had was with some of the AI. There was stealth sections where you would barley move just to sneak up on your attacker, not making a single noise just for them to quickly spin around and start shooting like they had heard you or seen you. This doesn't happen often, but it always resulted in a death for me as I was playing on a harder difficulty.,,Other then that, this is a masterpiece of a game. Anyone who loves story and character driven games and obviously owns a PS3 or PS4, this is a must buy.;normal;English;10

K-Crow;"The Last of Us is a truly beautiful game brought to us by an amazingly talented developer (Naughty Dog) who are also known for their Uncharted game franchise. The single-player story mode is where this game shines and where most of the work was put in on this game. With stunning graphics, near-perfect voice acting and motion capture performances, this game truly does feel like a movie, mostly because of it's deep characters and the realistic dialogue they share. The thing that truly makes this game beautiful is how well the game play of the single-player compliments it's deep story line. With many interesting and fun yet simple featuresmechanics that truly add to the game play and add some fun replay value, the game play is no way dragged out in the slightest and knows when to slow down to switch to a cut scene for some story exposition. While that is where most of ""The Last of Us""'s content lies, the multiplayer is nothing to sneeze at either. Most certainly differing far from any other game out there. It can get very competitive and is a blast to play with friends. It isn't perfect with a few noticeable balancing issues and not much content to delve into between matches. However, this game truly deserves high praise for it's beautiful, emotional and intelligent plot.";normal;English;10
Caveren59;I got the orignal PS3 version day one, and words cannot describe how much I adore this game. Again and again I have praised it to the max, recommending it to any gamer I come across. The graphics are phenomenal, and the multiplayer is a nice bonus, but it's the story that literally left me jaw open, almost crying that it was over. This is by far the best game of the PlayStation, possibly the best game of all time. (The Left Behind DLC is actually really well-made and worth the buy, too)  I wish the score went higher, because to me it is at least a 20/10. Please get this game, it is a must-have for all PS users. If you're an XBOX player....... SUCKS FOR YOU, BIATCH!;normal;English;10

PgomezP;An excellent game, so the gameplay as technical quality. The story is very good and immerses you in the game from the beginning to the end. The atmosphere is very faithful to an apocalyptic world. The edition has been remastered for ps4 a great job. I recommend it for all gamers.;expanded;English;9
SH1;This was very good, in fact I did not know how bad the current PS4 offering is until I played this. The fact that this is worth playing in the post-zombie craze era shows how good it is.

M_2_K;STORY,The storyline of the Last of Us is actually more dense and interesting than the blurb of its box initially implies. You'll play as Joel, a middle-aged man who makes his living by smuggling and exchanging in a series of often dangerous deals, to earn ration cards for survival. Sourced by the leader of the infamous milita group, the 'Fireflies', Joel and accomplice Tess are offered a desirable reward in exchange for transporting a young girl from point A to B (no questions asked). After Joel's reluctant acceptance, you begin to make your way through the overgrown and dead streets of America - most of which have been reclaimed by the Infected, who take increasingly threatening forms depending on the time they have spent with said infection. As the story begins to unfold, some of the most exciting and enjoyable plot points in gaming history take shape.,,GAMEPLAY,If the Last of Us was intended to feel like a true survival game, its remit has been fulfilled admirably in this case. You start from the very bottom, and the way you engage your enemies is tailored depending on your supplies. The game is relentless- if you run out of your bullets on your handgun, you will be forced to choose an alternate manner to clear your enemies, else rely on crafted bombs, melee weapons (which do have a short life) or anything else you may pick up. While your arsenal should expand as the game progresses, at many points I found myself having to resort to picked up bricks due to a lack of ammo in virtually all my weapons. I truly felt the struggle for survival. In a good way.,,GRAPHICS,Stunning. Perfect. Naughty Dog. I cannot fault the visuals. Stunning character models. Remastered beautifully for the PS4 (but there was not much to improve, mind you, as it pushed last-gen PS3 to its limits.),,VERDICT (10/10),The Last of Us is with out a shadow of a doubt the best game of our time. Its beautiful narration perfectly compliments the relatable, flawed (yet witty) characters who inhabit the visually unmatched post-pandemic America. The gameplay allows the player to feel a part of the experience unlike any other I have experienced. A gaming MASTERPIECE.;normal;English;10
J-pex;**If this had come out before The Walking Dead (which sucks) It would have made a WAAAAYYYY better story for a TV series.**,,I will rarely give a game 10/10, The Last Of Us is simply solid gold, ticking every box (at the time I'm writing this there are 247 negative reviews, these are most likely people who spend hours on black ops 3 - the worst game ever made and cannot appreciate how many levels other than shooting morons online this game excels on),,The remastered graphics and upped frame rate go a long way, but I hammered this game on ps3 when it came out, and back then it was unbelievably good.,,I can't think of a game that combines such an amazing story, fantastic voice acting and edge of your seat playing to compare it to, you get totally sucked in and the raw brutality and hardened world you enter has you thinking 'what would I do in that situation?'.,,Fantastically made, great acting, gem of a story and lets be honest people, killer cordyceps fungus!!??!! what's not to love?,,Solid 10/10;normal;English;10
Forgotten;If you enjoy storytelling and shooters you'll enjoy this adventure. Good but not great graphics, exceptional storytelling and interesting characters. The gameplay is okay, the different segments feel like they are repeating: explore, collect, shoot and repeat. It's hardly the most perfect game ever, just a very good one.;expanded;English;8
boysfan4life88;I bought the PS4 instead of Xbox One because I had heard such great things about this game and could not be happier.  It is very rare that a game turns out exactly the way you want it and this one did.  The graphics are amazing, but the (brief) voice acting is absolutely incredible.  It's a long game, but I found myself not wanting to play it towards the end, simply because I knew it was almost over.  I won't say anything about the ending or the story other than that it is amazing.  I went into this game knowing nothing about it, other than that there was a man and a girl.  This is how I recommend playing this game - knowing nothing about it beforehand.  Do yourself a favor and get this game today.  My experience playing it is almost on par with my experience of reading my favorite book of all time: Euphoric elation.;normal;English;10
stamito;This is definitely a good game, but, for me,  I don't know if I'd call it a masterpiece. The story and characters are really good and it is told in a very clever/good way. I don't really know how to explain it, but there is something missing. Maybe I found it a bit repetitive, the graphics and the environments are gorgeous but they feel pretty similar to me and you basically do the same thing over and over. This is hiding/killing monsters/humans and I know it is like this for 99.9% of the games, the game play just didn't impress me.,,However, the story is really good with some really moving moments and it is worth the money. I would just not start this game with a '10' expectation. I'd also recommend playing the game in a decent difficulty level otherwise you won't experience the anguish of survival, which in my opinion is part of the setting.;normal;English;8
road_runner;The Last of Us is one of the most emotional games I´ve ever played. It´s intense throughout and I love playing it on ps4. I felt like the ending was kind of open ended though. True masterpiece! Whoever hasn´t played it yet is really missing out. Ever since I got hooked, Im now looking at every other zombie apocalypse game as a downgrade. This is why I love Naughty Dog. They make one of the best games out there.;normal;English;10

Keldrinar;While The Last of Us is a linear story that borrows some elements from other literary and cinematic sources, its storytelling experience is, nevertheless, enthralling, riveting, immersive, haunting, and beautiful.  The writing, acting, graphics, sound, and gameplay all coalesce to create an unparalleled gaming experience, which some would say is even transformative.  By successfully inviting players to emotionally invest and care deeply about its characters, their relationships, and their choices, the Last of Us triumphs where many games with stellar production values fall short.  As mainly a PC gamer who has thoroughly enjoyed games such as Mass Effect 2, the original Deus Ex, System Shock 2, and Knights of the Old Republic, I have to go back to Thief: The Dark Project, a PC game from 1998, to remember when I cared so deeply about the fate of a game protagonist (Garrett in this case).,,Simply put:  If playing an amazing story is of interest to you (and you don't mind a post-apocalyptic/zombie bent), you owe yourself the favor of experiencing this game.  You can make the game as easy or challenging as you want from a gameplay perspective.;normal;English;10

angeloucalinga;The Last of Us Remastered is a great game. Graphics are awesome, Game play is awesome. The only downside of this game for me is the story line.

ricklongo;There are often times when I can't, for the life of me, understand why everyone in the western part of our world drools over a particular game. I believe there's no better example for this as The Last of Us, a title that got tens all around and was praised for its supposedly incredible storyline. Even though I had experienced several sections of the game on a friend's PS3, the PS4 was my first chance to try it for real, and I walked away sorely unimpressed.,,First of all, I fully admit to getting kind of worried whenever a title gets praised more for its story than its actual gameplay. It's the latter that will always matter the most in a game for me, and in this regard The Last of Us is passable at best, extremely forgettable at worst. It consists of a series of linear, quick-time-event-heavy, cover-based shooting stages that get repetitive really fast, with only mild incentives for any kind of exploration.,,Even though the game does feature a lot of actual cutscenes, its gameplay sections are made in such a way that main character Joel is always talking and interacting with other people somehow. I admit I can see how some people would enjoy this playable-movie vibe, but it's definitely not my thing. Often I would just get annoyed when a cutscene would end, just because I knew it meant I'd have to start actually playing. This made me start holding the opinion that The Last of Us would be better suited as, you know, an actual movie rather than a game.,,Speaking of which: yeah, there's a cool story here, with some well-written emotional gut-punches. But unlike what I've read around the web, it's absolutely nowhere near the level of the true storytelling masterpieces of our time, from A Song of Ice and Fire to Breaking Bad to The Sopranos (and yes, I've seen comparisons to all of those). Maybe that's because the script just feels like a known quantity in the time we live in: it has a post-apocalyptic setting (check), a hardened man getting to terms with his own emotions (check), zombie-thingies (check), dialogue sections filled with wise cracks that aren't all that fresh (check). It was just too 'been there, done that' for me, even with the emotional turns, and as a result I never really felt the father-daughter relationship between the main characters as apparently most people have.,,It may be one of those cases in which a game is just not for me, especially because I fully admit I've never been that interested in post-apocalyptic settings and its tropes. Still, just trying to analyse The Last of Us from a detached standpoint, I fail to see why it's had such an extremely enthusiastic reception. I wouldn't say it's a flat-out bad game, but there are numerous realistic-style titles with more fluid and satisfying gameplay, there are numerous non-games with better stories, and it is my honest opinion that this is not one of those cases in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.,,I think this is the kind of game that everyone should at least try, if only just to see what the fuss is all about. If your gaming tastes are anywhere close to mine, however, you'll probably get entertained for a while, then start seriously considering just searching for a cutscene compilation on Youtube instead.,,Rating: 5.5;normal;English;5

And the beautiful is supported by intense and tactical gameplay, along with gorgeous visuals and music.

MorrisSHM;There are not enough words to describe how I love this game. The game offers an amazing single player experience making it a must in your collection if you haven't played the ps3 version. Even if you have played it already, I will tell you that you will not regret buying it again, as now you will get the full experience and all at 1080p. It is a masterpiece that will remain as one of the best games of all time.;normal;English;10

Brainache;This is a reasonable single player game but it is let down by the fact that many of the levels are obviously designed for multiplayer and the multiplayer itself. The story is great and the game enjoyable on normal difficulty but it is extremely frustrating on the highest difficulty for anyone aiming for the platinum trophy or achievement completion. The multiplayer on the other hand is a visceral and unrewarding experience and not one that I found enjoyable in the slightest. The various events that can wipe out your accumulated survivors unless certain criteria are met are just ridiculous, but for me, the executions are just too much to handle. The multiplayer is dominated by veterans and the matchmaking always seems to throw a few into the game on each side. Weapon upgrades are lost with each new round so each match seems to reduce to gathering enough supplies to buy upgrades or make items in order to stand a chance. I've only the two online trophies to get but grinding for them has just ruined the whole experience of this game. I will never understand why developers insists on forcing multiplayer down my throat when all I want is an engaging but challenging story mode.;normal;English;4
ac_chris;"If a videogame can ever be considered a piece of art, than this game is one.,The touching story, that won´t ever leave your head again, if you have experienced it once and that made me feel more emotions than I would have thought were ever possible playing a game gets intensified by the best sound design/lighting/level design/gameplay etc. etc. that I personally have ever experienced in a game. The voice acting of the two protagonists provided by the excellent actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson is hands down absolutely top notch and you can even as a player feel how much those two got invested into the game theirselves. I could go on rambling about how great this game is for ages trust me, but let me put it shortly. To quote a prestigious gaming reviewer: ""Gamings Citizen Kane moment"" and if you know anything about movies you will know that there could`nt be a higher praise spoken out. And I totally agree in my humble opinion this game is not only generationdefining, it is defining the medium of videogames as a whole and shows how far the medium has come and what it is capable of.";normal;English;10

LawrenceLv;If it were someone else at the hospital, they may chose to sacrifice Ellie just like Marlene, who even watched Ellie grow up and promised her mother to take care of her.(Although it wasn't easy for her) However, it happens to be Joel who escorted Ellie there. Because of what he had lost 20 years ago and what he had been through with Ellie, he chose to save her the moment knowing she would die, without hesitation. Joel is not a selfless hero, yet a good story doesn't have to end with the salvation of humankind.,,Anyway, this game told us a good story.,,However, the design of some battles is so annoying. I still remember that wall-seeing-through sniper and that after the restaurant, when I was taking out the last hunter in the area by stealth, the game spawned another hunter(along with a few more elsewhere) just on my right side-I think there are better ways to increase the challenge of a battle, instead of forcibly adding enemies.;normal;English;7

t0mmyg;The Last of us Remastered is an unforgettable experience. The story and voice acting on display here takes the video game as an emotional investment to the next level. The game is heartwarming, tragic, bleak and moving. The characters are not one dimensional and are flawed and at times unlikeable, but ultimately that's what is great about this game. The world is filled with detail although fairly linear, there is tons and tons of eye candy to look at. The gameplay was enjoyable with a nice crafting system and combat that kept you immersed in the story. I would not say that the gameplay alone was anything particularly new or exciting though, enjoyable but didn't blow me away. The last of Us had me tearing up several times. Not since Final Fantasy 7 or Mass Effect 2 has a game gripped me with characters and situations this much.;normal;English;9

DeusXCom;It didn't really blow my mind as I thought it would based on all the praise, it just felt like I've already seen this all before somewhere and it lacked that additional touch that would make it a true masterpiece, but it's still an excellent game, perfectly executed in every single way. There are no weak points. From beautiful environments, to fluid gameplay, great soundtrack and captivating story. Definitely the best game Naughty Dog produced to this day. The problem I always had with Uncharted are too many shooting segments, there are still here, but they can be solved by stealth, or just sneaked it all the way through, combine it with a solid crafting system to enhance these elements further, finally the 60fps on PS4 and the result is overall a fantastic game. 9/10;normal;English;9

tgchan;"I was born in 1985. I have been playing games since I can remember, but this game... was one of my best experiences I have ever had in past 20 years or so, not only in games but also in films! You can't, not think about it as a god damn, top notch film, even with its amazing gameplay. After the game, I was sitting and looking at the menu screen, listening to the amazing soundtrack, and trying to pull myself together, after this emotional journey... I would love to describe it, but I can't... You have to scavenge, survive and live through it on your own... Only then, you can see the unbelievable level of accomplishment this game has achieved. The only thing I would change, would be the difficulty. I have finished the game on the maximum difficulty(grounded), and I believe this should be the only option. If you are reading this before playing it, trust me and do yourself a favour, play it on GROUNDED level. Every arrow, every bullet and other junk, will become the greatest treasure and asset of your playstyle and tactic. It will make it as realistic as possible, you will fear every dark place, noise and every enemy can be your last encounter if handled improperly. I have watched the ""making of"" afterwards, and seeing some of the gameplay in it, made me realised, how much of the real experience people are missing by choosing the easier options... Developers made it really fair, with a little thinking and few tries, you can make it, overcome the impossible. It's about the survival in a post-apocalyptic world where death awaits behind every corner, don't make a point and click game for kids out of it... Anyways, after almost 28 hours of the emotional roller-coaster, it is so hard to shake it off... The ending was great, I am fully satisfied with it. I hated every dark and scary part of the game, I felt terrible and my heart was going nuts but... I miss Ellie and Joel... we have been through so much... It is so hard to forget... I really do miss them, and I think about going back into this dark and hostile world, just to be with them a little longer...";normal;English;10

MaximumD;This is basically how this game was made. Bunch of people went into the boardroom and decided they will make a walking/murder simulator and then attach a story about the beauty and frailty of human life to it. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to get into that when I've just murdered about 500 faceless guys, who apparently are just trying to get by like everyone else. Oh the girl is the innocent one, I get it. Nope, you murder about 50 people with her too at some point. I like the gameplay, it's smooth and the AI is decent, but it gets old after doing the same old crap for the entire game. All you do slowly walk to an area, watch a cutscene, murder about 15 guys either via sneak kills or just flat out beating their skulls in, and then repeat.,,Yeah, graphics are good and the base gameplay is solid, but I'm sorry the story is so overrated and the game gets real boring fast. Not to mention the plank sections that are just annoying, preventing you from continuing the walking simulator portion of the game. Which just takes you  to the next area to murder about 50 dudes. It deserves a decent score because of the production values and polished gameplay, which eventually just gets old. Oh and a bonus for an awesome online mode. The online mode is actually the true gem of this product. Sorry, but overall, way overrated. Online makes it a 7 instead of a 6.;normal;English;7

lightyears;Good game with unfortunately also some negative aspects. It has a great story and characters. Graphics are impressive and in-game sounds are among the best ever. But the game is also very linear. For me that is something of the past. The new chapter in game development are games where own decisions change story and lead to different endings (like Witcher 3). Where you have an open world to freely explore. Where you can leave the main quest to go for side quests. Where you have multiple ways to solve problems. Unfortunately the Last of Us doesnt deliver this. It is extremely linear. You have no real choices to make. But have to do anything the way the game developers want you to do it. That said, its still one of the best linear RPG's of the last years. Altough the quality of gameplay varies during the game. For the greatest part the atmosphere is really impressive. The virtual world looks great. The graphics are very good and the sounds are incredible. Unfortunately there are also moments that the gameplay gets annoying. Espesially during a lot of action, the controls are not always optimal. And by the way: in some parts of the game throwing a bottle towards your enemies is much more effective than shooting with a gun. So the next time you encounter a bear or a tiger in your real life leave your gun in your bag and just throw a bottle at it and you will be wonderfully fine. (Sarcasm) So the game does have its flaws. But for the greatest part its still an impressive experience. However for me the linear story and some annoying moments dont make it worth a 95 score. I say its worth 80 on a 100 point scale.;normal;English;8
Sunykamey;TLOU is a very good game at its core but stumbles over gameplay mechanics. The AI battles (be it human or infected) get repetitive fast. They almost ever require you to decoy-takedown-sneakpast. I understand the great ratings this game gets and they are well deserved (atmosphere, graphic, voice acting, story telling are among the best) but the game isn't flawless. The best parts of the game are when there are no encounters with anything, in this moments it shines. But beware if you get fast bored of repetitive gameplay (meaning scenarios that play out - at their core - exactly the same and there is no denying that a change of scenery doesn't change that drastically) then you have to decide for yourself if the rest of the game is worth the effort. For me it still is, but I can't play this game more than an hour every session (still want to finish it).;normal;English;7
Tynamo;Best Game I played on the PS4, Glad I picked the game up! The story, the character development, it was all put perfectly. Don't even get me started with the graphics, it's one of the best I've ever seen. Well deserved 10/10;expanded;English;10
Desi101don;"This game should be only be praised for its gorgeous graphics and absolutely mind-blowing depressing story. This was my first time playing the last of us so I can't really completely compare between the previous and the remastered one.,,First I will be talking about the story. It is mind-blowing campaign as it engages you in the aftermath of the zombie breakout(the most over used cliché) which forces the people into the law of the jungle which is ""only the fittest will survive"" who kill each other for food and ammunition. You will be able explore those kinds of people through a protagonist who is survivor who even kills people to survive. All of the characters in the story are flawless you cannot nitpick anything about them. Eventhough the characters want the same thing( to survive) there is always something different about them which the game explores in depth. The only thing I thought the story could improve on is multiple decisions or even multiple endings if they put more time in and more effort. Eventhough they put a lot effort into this game. The game can be interactive but quite limited,,Now the actual gameplay. The gameplay does suffer a few flaws. The cons is the listen mode which you can turn off but once used its impossible not to use it again. The listen mode is basically finding where your enemies are which completely ruin the tension on finding your enemies. And killing them them in stealth very easily.But makes the game a bit strategic though. There isn't anything unique about the enemies at all but the clickers in my opinion are awesome( which is the only unique enemy). The AI can be predictable as you trace their tracks. But when it comes to your companion (yes , you will have a companion) they will actually help you defeat your enemies properly which make the game more realistic. You will also often fail due to your death or your companion's death. So in exchange for their help you will often have to help them as well. Exploration in this beautiful environment will be awarded (note-its not an open world game) as you will be given ammunition and crafting components. I found it quite addictive doing this. The ammunition is limited which makes sense since its a survival horror and a range of guns to use. There is also a crafting system which allow you to make realistic items. You can unlock new abilities as well. You can also upgrade your guns however you cannot simply press the option menu to upgrade it. Instead you have to go to specific areas where you will be able to upgrade your guns etc. In my opinion I wish this game like Dishonored have gameplay freedom where you could choose how you wanted to play since this is story-driven game. There is combat and it looks great. Every time you try to hit it someone it is always unique,,Final verdict: Outstanding story and flawless characters but with a good gameplay with a few flaws which make it less satisfying. I would have given this game a 7/10 due to the unsatisfying gameplay but I could't ignore the engaging story at all thus lead to my decision of a 8/10";normal;English;8
Fantise1;As a huge fan of the Uncharted series and other Naughty Dog games, I was pleased to find that the Last of Us is easily one of the greatest games of all time. The story could easily rival some of Hollywood's greatest works and the game play, while not really creative or 'new,' is enticing and terrifying. The AI might not be perfect (especially the partner AI) and some of the melee combat seems forced and awkward. However, the overall package is amazing. The story may have a good amount of zombie cliches, but because of how the story is portrayed (through incredible voice acting and one of the best visually stunning games) is what makes the story is endearing. The ending may not feel complete, but in a way, the world that the game portrays is not complete. The ending is bittersweet and fits the tone of the game amazingly. All in all, The Last of Us is a beautiful game and if you have already played the game on the PS3, it is worth it to revisit the game on the PS4. Also, the DLC that comes with the game is equally amazing, and in some ways it surpasses the quality of the original.;normal;English;10
ilijazunic55;A true masterpiece in both the story-telling and gameplay aspect. Only gets a 9 for me, for some times spammy multiplayer (you can make a case for it not even having a place in this game), and a few in-game cliches. Great game.;expanded;English;9

Set in a post apocalyptic wasteland after the world fell to a parasitic infection, you play as Joel, a man apart tormented by loss and grief making it by day by day trying to find something to live for, That something become Ellie a teenage girl who holds the potential of a cure bringing the world to salvation, while also bringing back Joel to a world he had long thought forgotten. Set as a survival horror, ammo and supplies are scarce however with weak stealth mechanics and sometime weak combat scenarios then only real praise can be given to the story which holds up over the games 8 hour long campaign;normal;English;8

Optimus-Prime;The best story driven game I have ever played. The visuals, music, writing and voice acting had me invested in characters that felt real. For once I didnt feel like some overpowered superhero that could kill hundreds of infected without breaking a sweat like most post-apocalyptic games. Instead, on the hardest difficulties, I had to plan my approaches, scavenge and craft my way through and pick my battles. Gameplay mechanics work well although some stealth sections can feel slightly repetitive but a great balance between these sections and action packed shoot-outs make them bearable. Multiplayer requires  team based coordination and strategy that is refreshing from most 'lone wolf' all guns blazing style multiplayers that crowd the market. However, matches do tend to become one sided if someone decides to go it alone and ends up getting killed or if someone goes AFK.,,In conclusion, there is no doubt this game is a 'must have'. Those which have played this game before on PS3 wont find anything new or exciting, but if you're new to playstation or didnt buy the game for the PS3 now is the time to get it, you will not regret it.;normal;English;9

If this game doesn't give you feels you may be dead inside and want to get that checked out.,,Aesthetically it looks pretty great, especially the character models which are fantastic. It performs well enough at 60fps most of the time, although it takes a **** whenever you're near water for some reason, but on the whole it's fine. The voice work is top notch and really helps push the story, Ellie is pretty hilarious at times.,,Ignoring the wonderful single player experience the game also boasts a highly enjoyable 4v4 multiplayer mode, which is fully fleshed out with countless maps, weapons and fluff items. The loadout system is very much like CoD where you have a set amount of points to speed to create your own unique build. It's a very slow paced, tactical game mode where stealth is key, I was honestly surprised at how good it was, it's definitely not just tacked on for the sake of it.,,In short, if you own a PS4 you owe it to yourself to play this game as it's very special.;normal;English;10
JohnsonStJonson;My mom gave me $80 for my birthday. On my way to the brothel, a man offered this game in exchange for all $80. I decided it was a good deal since he had a long kitchen knife pointed at my chest. Needless to say, I was essentially forced into this game. The gameplay itself isn't super great and you find that the collection of weapons is almost meaningless by the end of the game. The real value of the Last of Us lies in its storytelling. It puts your morals on spin cycle and presents them to you at the end of the game, changed from what they were before. It makes us all long for someone special to be with, even if it means the end of the world as we know it. That was a quote from the movie 2012 btw.,You either love it or you hate it, much like my Dad-Bod.

DanHugoStiglitz;“The Last of Us” is a masterpiece story-driven game developed with care and refined from almost every perspective. The screenplay and the dialogues are intense, and the combat encounters are well engineered.

badgerpoop;As someone who has switched over from an Xbox lineage, I didn't quite know what to expect. This game was included with my PS4 so I figured I'd play it out before getting another game. I beat this game in about a week. Incredible, immersive story. Graphics are beautiful. This game will make you FEEL what the characters are feeling. Online was mediocre, I would have loved to have seen a co-op option for the main story-line or a players vs zombies type game-mode on there but the campaign was strong enough to carry the game as is, so I suppose online it just a bonus.;normal;English;10
Kaprawiec;"After seeing ale the 10/10 and game of the Year awards I was realli intrigued whats all the fuss about. So lets se what do we have here.,1) Story - another zombie flick. If this story was presented as a movie it would recieve average scores in about 7/10. Maybe a bit more but nobody with brain wouldnt give it 10 out of 10. So lets look elsewhere for the game of the year factor.,2) Gameplay - Nathan Drake is back! Wait, its not Nathan but he sure does look a lot like him, moves like him, shoots like him, fight like him. So in general it is him but in another setting and with different goals. The whole ""uncharted"" gameplay is not bad, but nothing new or special. We got stealth. This is NOT MGS, stealth is quite broken for me. I completed the game on hard and I was frustrated when enemies saw me when they werent supposed to. Whats funny they dont see my companions running like a fools and almost bumping into them. Very realistic. We also can craft things and upgrade weapons (which is quite ok) but we all saw that elsewhere and it was done better elsewhere. Whats worse, we got lots of fights. Figths that are not as fun as they should be. I was tired of seeing another horde of humans/infected attacking me again and again. At the end of the story I was wondering who killed more humans - plague or Joel... This was very anticlimatic for me. I liked the exploration part more than the fighting and the game would be better if Naughty Dog didnt throw so much enemies at us.,So from me gameplay is solid 8/10 - quite good but glithed and not as fun as it could be - definitely not a game of the year gameplay.,3) Visuals/Music - Graphics are nice, clean with quite a few good looking sceneries. Animation is also really good. But that damn corridors. We got Year 2015. You cant expect somebody to be amazed by graphics in AAA title where You move through damn corridors. How stupid can it get - You go into the wood and gues what? Youre in a corridor. The objective is to go to the bridge. On the way there are enemies. No, You cant go around them, BECAUSE YOURE IN A F***IN CORRIDOR!!! This is just dumb.,But wait - this is the best game on PS3 according to critics and players. So... lets grab an axe and try to hack the table to pieces. Nothing. Lets break window with a brick. Nothing! But the axe itself is made from glass i guess because it gets broken after 4 slashes. Damn... Ok I guess I want to much (but again - game of the year...I could destroy almost everything in enviroment in Black on PS2... over 10 years ago...). Fair score for the graphics is 7+/10.,,As You can see this is NOT the best game I played and in my opinion all of You who gave this game easy 10/10 for touching story - You probably wouldnt do that if it was a movie, or the book. So unfortunatelly this show that the gaming industry in terms of storytelling is far behind other entertainment sources.,And thats why the most important thing in games is gameplay. I hope I explained in details why the score this 8 out of 10 and why I rate simple games that base on excellent gameplay like geometry wars higher than most of current AAA titles.";normal;English;8
WoshJills;Last of Us: A+,Left Behind: A-,Factions Multiplayer: A+,,I've been playing the same game for 2 years now -- since the day it came out -- on two different consoles, and I still learn new things. Try to defy the game? Characters will present hidden dialogs. Go into new places? Cue protagonist gaffs. This is 100% a masterpiece, from the music, to the artwork, to the story, to the silly pun joke book in Left Behind that nearly goes on forever. The single-player campaign is filled with lore and additional stories that can be read and learned alongside environment art. Combined with trophies and collectables, the game has a very, very long lifecycle. In addition, two years after the game's release Naughty Dog still makes improvements and tweaks to the gameplay to balance and refine it. The DLC has helped make sure the multiplayer servers will stay up for a long time with streams of revenue.,,My only gripe is that there isn't more to play and Left Behind is a little too short -- beatable in one day. Hopefully there will be a Last of Us 2, though I'd rather the title stay a standalone masterpiece before turning into a giant cow of a franchise to be milked until dry.;normal;English;10

MaxPayneIsGod;"A masterpiece in every sense of the word.  Playing Remastered was my 3rd playthrough so I put it on Grounded mode.  Needless to say this is simply how The Last of Us is supposed to be played.  Quite possibly the best game I have every played and that's nearly 3 decades of gaming.  It looks magnificent, plays perfectly, sounds amazing. The story is beautiful and ""real"", the characters are believable, their relationship and how it develops is one of, no the best, most realistically developed in any video game.  I love Joel, I love how he relates to Ellie, I think of Ellie as my own, no game has ever had this effect on me before and I doubt any will since.  From the opening scenes to the perfect final words, The Last of Us is a masterpiece and will go down in history as one of the best stories ever told. Finally got into the multiplayer, which I normally steer well clear of. This time, from someone who predominantly plays solo games, multiplayer is awesome and meaning full with a really simple but well executed story and excellent, different game types.,Perfect, there is no other word for it.";normal;English;10

okc_rocker;I truthfully couldn't figure out why this game has such high scores. And the only reason I can find is that people must have loved the story. It's a good game. Don't get me wrong. But what makes this game deserve a 7/10? Well for starters, the item base is very limited. Yes I understand it is a survival game, but more options would be nice. Also there aren't many enemy types. It just felt like I was killing the same enemies over and again in the same manner. The story did have a flaw. I predicted basically the entire story from start to finish. The Last of Us is entertaining at best. But is it worthy of a perfect score? Most definitely not.;normal;English;6
George_B1981;This is the greatest game I have ever played. Amazing story, controls, combat is perfect in every way. Graphics / Visuals are sensational!!

Epik_Ninnja;I never played the original game because I don't own a PS3 so I knew I'd be getting this game for the PS4. If you've already played TLOU on the PS3, this game likely isn't enough incentive to buy it again, although it does include a higher frame rate and resolution as well as 2 multiplayer map packs and a single player DLC (Left Behind).,As for single player, it's great. The environment is always detailed and beautiful and the combat is always intense. You won't just be fighting variations of the berserk infected but other survivors as well, mostly ones who want to kill you for your supplies. You can craft various items such as Molotov cocktails and health items as well as swallow pills to upgrade different abilities and use miscellaneous parts to upgrade your variety of firearms. On top of the gameplay is the emotional story which involves a harsh middle-aged man escorting and eventually bonding with a young girl of 14. The game is great from start to finish but not quite the masterpiece it's made out to be.,Lastly, there's multiplayer which is a fun extra but not fantastic in my opinion. There are three modes as well as custom loadouts and characters. Again, it's fun, but play this game for its single player.;normal;English;9
Animator97;BEST GAME EVER MADE, AND BEST GAME THAT WILL EVER BE MADE. Anyone who hates this game should be beaten. I know there are those who are skeptics. Yes it's linear. Yes it's about zombies. Is it cliché. Hell to the no!!!!! It has an unbeatable story that open world games, and RPG's die to have, and graphics that impress continually. The characters are real, the experience is extremely emotional and the gameplay is perfect. Even with zombies, this is the most realistic game I have ever played. Everything that you do in the game, you could do in real life. They even based the disease that the zombies have, on a real life disease that exists in the insect world. The feeling that you could die at any second is always evident. This game is challenging, and those who pick a difficulty that they cannot handle will perish. It is very realistic in every way. You supplies are extremely limited and since you play as a 50 year old man through 90 percent of the game, you are at somewhat of a disadvantage at being a man of action. The hand to hand combat looks so real, as you put your full body into every punch. The game is lengthy, and the conclusion is so bad ass. Not to mention the absolutely great DLC Left Behind, that is free with the Remastered Edition. This is a game that even though it is linear, it never gets old. You can play it again and again forever, and you will never grow tired of it. It didn't win Game of the Year twice for nothing. Anyone who hates this game needs serious help. BUY IT!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;normal;English;10

Creery;The Last of Us is easily one of the best games I have ever played. Not necessarily for pure game play but rather that it offers a experience which you don't want to leave and will remember long after the credits have rolled.,,You can easily spend hours more than you should wondering what will happen round the next corner. The storyline and the way the characters develop is second to none, you believe their stories just as you would with a well written/acted film.,,Naughty Dog should be immensely proud of what they have produced and I for one would happily pre-order a sequel today.;normal;English;10
jake_hewitt;This game is quire simply a masterpiece.,,Before playing the remastered version i hadn't played the original on PS3 as zombie game had never appealed to me. i only ended up playing the remastered version after acquiring a free digital copy when i got my PS4 otherwise i would of probably never picked it up.,,I went into the game quite sceptical . But after the first  short intro segment i was hooked. From then i played the entire campaign over two days, the story is just so gripping i couldn't put the controller down.,,Its based in a post apocalyptic world in which a fungus called Cordyceps has infected humans leading to a a zombie outbreak, i really like the original spin on the zombie outbreak its different and refreshing. the main plot involves the transport of a young girl called Ellie to a research lab as she has an immunity to the fungus. Ellie is accompanied by Joel who is the main playable character. The way the bond between these two main character grows throughout there journey is masterful the writers at Naughty Dog are brilliant to have made the characters feel so real. As well as the game designers for making the world so harsh and horrible to have to live through but absolutely stunning from where the player sits.,,Whatever your taste in games you will be touched by the story this game has to tell and therefore you have to play it. the only other thing i have to say is will The Last Of Us get a sequel?;normal;English;10
jozee1981;What is there to say? It's the G.O.A.T.  The enhanced graphics were not super-noticeable to me but the game already looks brilliant.  Nothing was ruined from the original version and that's really all that matters here.  Can't wait to play Left Behind!;expanded;English;10

OblivWrathy;"The Last of Us, without a doubt, tops my list for the best game I've ever played. The game on PS3, alone, was the best, but adding it to the next-generation console made the game even better, although it seemed impossible.,,The plot itself is enough to make the game fantastic. Adding Bruce Straley's great gameplay-directing, together with Neil Druckmann's amazing story-directing, makes the game perfectly balanced between gameplay and story. This unbelievable game, even though it's known, still hasn't reached out to that many  people, which is sad, because they're missing out on something that is truly life changing for hundreds of thousands people, including myself.,,""From Dreams: The Making of The Last of Us"" shows the work and dedication made to make this game possible is incredible. It only goes to show how they persevered even though they faced difficulty. It also shows the actors doing their absolute best performance to make the game as good as possible, cut-scene -wise. Troy Baker (AKA Joel,) made his best performance in this given scene: When the apocalypse has just happened, he meets up with his brother Tommy, and they escape from the horde of infected. They find this military soldier who, even though he doesn't want to, shoots his daughter Sarah. The way Joel reacts is so scarily realistic, it made me cry, which is a hard thing when it comes to video games.,,As for Ashley Johnson (AKA Ellie,) made her best performance when she is in the ranch, right after she goes away from Joel, and says ""Is that all they really had to worry about? Boys, movies, deciding which shirt goes with which skirt? It's bizarre."" Followed by another great performance by Troy, makes the scene very emotional indeed.,,Long sentence said short, The Last of Us is a life-changing, perfect game for me. The A.I is just about perfect for the game's purpose, and has taken gaming into the next level with it's no game in the future can even compare with The Last of Us. A clear 10/10 from me.";normal;English;10
DragonBorn-;What a game this is. From start to finish this game grips and excites you. It's all about survival you can't help but get right into the storyline as the characters are just average normal people it's so easy to relate to them and put yourself in that situation.,,The graphics, the locations, the backdrop, the noises, the music has all been carefully put together and is totally in sync with each other. The atmosphere is frightening with strange noises or footsteps echoing around the corner.,,No negatives at all to speak of (wish the storyline lasted longer as it is so good is the only thing). This game is close to perfection and totally unique. Easily the game of the year and just as easily in my top 10 of all time games as it is so different from the standard RPG/FPS/Adventure games out there. Ignore the handful of negative comments about tiny irrelevant details. THIS GAME IS AWESOME.,,Ive basically just copied and pasted my previous review of the PS3 version because its pretty much the same as the remastered version. The extra fps and slightly more refined graphics just makes it that little bit more awesome. Here's to TLOU2;normal;English;10
dacritic82;"This game is a masterpiece. Pretty much everything in it is outstanding. The music, the graphics, the story, the characters.

UserScore;"I am not rating the game, but the port. The review for the game can be found in the profile.,The Last of Us: Remastered is a very good port. Although the 1080p isn't a huge change (even if it can be more of an improvement when you are looking at things in the distance), 60 fps are much appreciated. The game feels a lot smoother, it helps for making fast moves and it helps the overall expeience of multiplayer.,Photo Mode is a cool addition, though in terms of frames and filters it's a bit scarce. It's not like you will be using it a lot in your first playthrough, but I'm sure fans will have a good time trying to capture the game's beauty.,In terms of content, TLOU Remastered packs everything except the additional weapons and hats, which is a frustration for anyone who bought any of them and now moved on to the PS4 version. Considering it contains the excellent ""Left Behind"" DLC, and some cool maps, TLOU Remastered (I think) completely justifies it's price tag.,There's also the Grounded doccumentary and commentary form Neil Druckmann, Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson for all the cinematics (though that doesn't include Left Behind, for some odd reason).,All in all TLOU Remastered is the definitive version of The Last of Us, though I wouldn't recommend it to players who have already experience the PS3 version.  But if you're a newcomer, there's absolutely no reason not to play this game.,Overall Rating: 8.0/10";normal;English;8

JMARSseph;The greatest game ever made......period. No other game before it has told a better, more human story than The Last of Us. The characters are strong, from the leads in Joel and Ellie, to each and every other character they are all given a defined life of their own. They all represent a side of humanity and the game does a fantastic job of creating each one as an individual, a unique individual. In hearing Hollywood is producing a movie, I cringed. They could not do justice to this story. At least not in a 1 to 3 hour movie. Perhaps a miniseries, 10 part, 10 hours. Anyway back to the game. The mechanics work just fine, the gameplay is great, the shooting, running, melee, all are top notch. The story grabs you from the start and does not let you go. I am a huge fan of Mass Effect and the development of each character within its story. The Last of Us creates a bond between player and characters like no other game. The entire game focuses on struggle, loss and the human desire to fight on and find any hope you can to drive you. I thought this would be another zombie game...I could not have been more wrong. Sure zombies infest the world, but the real terror is the people. Last of Us captures humanity in all its ugliness, and does it beautifully. I am 42 years old and have played games forever. I remember Zelda, wow, I remember a lot of great titles. Last of Us is truly in the argument for greatest game ever....period.;normal;English;10

Thegodfatherson;At one point in the brutal epic, The Last Of Us, Joel and Ellie share almost a father to daughter moment, and I felt like Naughty Dog doesn't need the success of Uncharted 4, because TLOU is a bracing masterpiece with a human nature and an unforgettable story that rewinds in my mind nights after finishing it. The aftermath of a virus, leave the world to senseless anarchy and corruption, and a group called the Fireflies fights it, there is no fair government. There are creepy clickers and runners lurking around the whole place which looks damn great on new hardware. Joel and Marlene are hired to protect Ellie, a girl with a special gift, she is immune to the virus. The amount of gritty tension during the stealth sequences of TLOU is harrowing and will leave you nights, sleepless. With great voice acting from Troy Baker as the rough Joel, may be his best yet. Naughty Dog is one developer that keeps surprising us each time, Uncharted already has acclaim, but if you play TLOU, you will be amazed. BTW, If you don't have it already, you are living under a rock, my friend. I replayed this epic three times and can't wait to do it again. The Left Behind DLC is included in this great package, and boy, for a DLC, it's brilliant. Left Behind tells Ellie's story behind the events of The Last Of Us. The Last Of Us is something Stanley Kubrick would have been proud of. It has incredible depth, great characters, jaw dropping visuals, and a hint of human that is not found in other games. Get a PS4 already, Xbox Fanboys!;normal;English;10
Kondorp96;This is a game that i would recommend to any gamer who values story, and great stealth game play with a solid combat system, it is a must play game! the story between the main protagonist and the second protagonist is very in depth and makes you care about them. as you play through the story, their relationship continues to grow and you see this through many trials they are forced to go through together, in which brings them closer together. The story is that you're 20 years into an infection that gives humans a form of rabies via a mind controlling fungus (Which is real in our world, Scary!) and you must transport a girl that may be born with a cure, i won't go any further for spoiler reasons, but this is the basis of the story, you travel cross country fighting everything from infected to other survivors who are trying to kill everyone and salvage everything they can, Naughty Dog has knocked it out of the park with this game, the graphics are amazing and will stand it's ground in the gaming community for some time to come, the emotion that comes out in this game could bring you to tears at certain moments (It did for me) and you will find yourself actually caring about what happens in this game. the people you come across are varied enough to seem real, they each have their own personalities and opinions, this is such an alive game, I've beaten it and it still to this day blows me away. It adds more replay value with the Left Behind DLC and Factions Multiplayer that forces you to choose a faction and fight on that faction through different game modes, it also features a mini meta game that you help your clan grow by doing good in games.;normal;English;10
Ladders44;"The game deserves the perfect scores. It is almost flawless. The graphics are now amongst the best on next generation systems and the gameplay mechanics are addicting and satisfying with the perfect amount of challenge. You have probably heard enough about the story but it is an emotional rollercoaster that you simply have to ride. It's a game that comes up maybe once every 10 years that you don't want to stop playing and when you do you are a complete wreck, and even worse when it's finished you'll  ask yourself ""Now what am I going to do?!"" The game is one of the most memorable I have played, I could tell you about each and every section of the game which you can't say about most games...just buy the game.";normal;English;10
UnKn0wN_DiSeAsE;"This is one of the most immersing game experiences I've ever had. I actually felt as if I had become Joel, trekking through this deadly, near hopeless world, struggling to survive for just one more day. On occasion, this level of immersion is broken, but for the most part, I truly felt like I had stepped into the shoes of the protagonist. His emotions became mine- the frustration, the elation, the horror, the desperation... and the slow, creeping pall of hopelessness in this dark, damaged earth.,,If you are prone to night terrors or depression, do NOT play this game, because it will alternately terrify you and make you despair for the plight of this lost world. However, if you can handle the mature subjects of the tale, you are in for a real treat, and perhaps the greatest game to ever be produced in the genre of survival horror.,,Yes, this game is scary, to a level I haven’t felt since the original Silent Hill on PS1. I generally felt powerless in this world and some of the enemies (primarily Clickers and Runners) make my stomach tighten with dread. If you're super hardcore, and you want a REALLY scary experience, I recommend you play on Hard difficulty for your first play-through, because the number of supplies (ammo, med kits, shivs, bombs, etc.) that are available on the Normal difficulty level are far too abundant for players who want a supreme challenge.,,On the subject of crafting, this is a component of the game that is easy to learn, and fun to engage in. It further puts you into the mindset of Joel, a man desperate for survival, who has learned to salvage at all available opportunities. Slowly tuning up my weapons was also a lot of fun, though Joel is but a pale imitator compared to his rival protagonists (Nathan Drake, Marcus Fenix, etc.) in other games (but this is a good thing, for it feels realistic, and fits with the tone of the piece). Joel's wobbly aim, perpetual shortage of ammo, and rather sluggish speed make him feel like a real, middle-aged guy who has learned to survive in a dangerous world, not some superhuman who handles everything with grace.,,The stealth aspect is also handled brilliantly, and engaging in it is extremely satisfying. This stealth system is a perfect evolution of that which was established in the Metal Gear Solid series (particularly #2), utilizing a great visual cone and audio circumference for your enemies, which must be studied for vulnerabilities and exploited at every possible opportunity. Determining how to approach each new challenge (lots of trial and error will be involved), and how to successfully clear an area of enemies (generally without being detected, as ammo and health are so limited) is really fun. These challenges become ""3D puzzles"" in a way, as you must use your noggin to break down enemy patterns and AI reactions, with the added tension of knowing that it only takes one slip-up to result in failure - and these enemies really do make you feel the fear.,,Visually speaking, this game is remarkable, even by next gen standards. The improved graphics of the Remastered edition are immediately apparent to those who of us who played The Last of Us on PS3. Resolutions are incredibly detailed, but even more effective is the silky smooth frame rate. The attention to detail is simply staggering, and it all comes together to further enhance the emotional impact of this unforgettable experience. Gameplay is always more important than graphics in my book, but it certainly helps convey the emotions of the characters when everything looks this darned good.,,The Last of Us is like nothing else. It is, quite frankly, an exhausting experience, one that left my mind reeling with the consequences of my fascinating journey, and the unbreakable bonds I had formed with Ellie and Joel - two fictitious characters who seem unshakably real. I just can’t forget about them, and I can’t forget about what we’ve been through together. It’s not just their story, it’s OUR story. We are family, struggling to survive in a dangerous world. We are the last of us.";normal;English;10

guynamedanthony;"This was the first game I played when I bought a PS4, I must say I was very impressed. The graphics are compelling, the environment is immersive, walking through a deserted suburb neighborhood, looking at all the abandoned houses, piles of burnt bodies, and flooded cities, and how Joel and Tess are so numb from the apocalypse that killing someone is just an everyday thing, makes you think what people are capable of when the situation is so grave. The story is unlike anything I've experienced in a video game, the ending really leaves you in the dark in some ways, and that's okay. It almost leaves you to decide what goes through Ellie's mind when she said that final ""okay"" and then the game cuts to black. It has one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I've played, the 4v4 matches, while it may sound very boring, Naughty Dog really did a great job with it. It feels like real combat, you're always behind cover, planning your course of action, hoping an enemy isn't around the corner when you have no ammo while they're fully loaded ready to go. Every time I die, it feels like I really die, and that I didn't help out my team enough, and I've never felt this playing a game. It really requires you to communicate with your teammates, plan out tactics, call out enemies, or just go lone wolf and hope for the best. The maps for the most part, are well designed, it could use more game modes, leveling up can be quite difficult at times, but overall, its really an above average experience in my opinion. This is a must-have for PS4 owners, It's just a great game.";normal;English;9
SandrigoGamer;"There isn't much to say about this game that haven't been already said by millions of players and reviewers in this world, but it's yet important to emphasize the masterpiece that this game is, and how he doesn't compare itself to any other production in recent history. The heartbreaking story between Joel and Ellie and all the other small stories that appear and disappear are just impossible to forget. The last of us is one of those few games that leave you thinking about the decisions that the characters made. After I finished it for the first time, I must say I had a hard time trying to sleep, just thinking those ""what if"" infinite possibilities.

As of March 2015, this game is still the must own game on the PS4. The game runs 1080p 60fps. The game is just perfect.,,Ellie and Joel are a perfect combination together. The acting and the story are perfect. The game runs about 12 hours, depending on difficulty. The gameplay is fantastic. The melee and the gunplay is excellent. The graphics look so smooth when it is running 60 frames per second. The story is beautiful.,,I thought the game was really good the first time I played it. Then the second time I played, I thought it was a masterpiece.  The story becomes more and more beautiful when you play it more. Then the multiplayer is a surprising fun mode. There are three modes. Supply raid, interrogation, and survivors. Overall the game is beautiful and is one of the greatest games ever made. 10/10.";normal;English;10
Confo;This was the best game that I've played in my life, with one of the most emotional stories ever told in video games and a rewarding gameplay that keeps you on the edge of the seat it defines what a video games should be about. If someone asks me what a perfect video games is, The Last of Us is the perfect example. It mixes story and gameplay in a way that no other game really has, the two things that you want from a game.;normal;English;10
SuperAC;One of the best games I've ever played. It has a great storyline packed with emotion and brilliant gameplay with a real zombie apocalypse feel. Well done Naughty Dog!;expanded;English;9
Firedthaboss;I don't get all the praise of this game. I came here expecting something as great as GTA V but what I got was only great. GAMEPLAY: This is where The Last of Us falls flat. The game has semi linear levels but gives you room to explore and you might find supplies and craft Molotovs, Medkits, and the like. However there are only 6 components. You can only carry a set amount of components however you can't have for example 3 rags but 1 sugar but can carry 2 rags but 2 sugar. So there's no dynamic inventory system. The gameplay starts to become a drag near the end.,STORY: This game shines as with it's story. While it's predictable the characters are likable but Joel AKA you makes a scripted selfish choice that makes him come off as a giant **** a choice that could make the human race be completely wiped out and breaking a friend's dying wish. Ellie is extremely likable and actually makes me wish she deserved better someone then Joel. I don't want be a perfect character, however I don't want to be a selfish douche who makes a selfish choice that could endanger all of humanity. OVERALL: This game should be a movie, not a game. While The Walking Dead from TT gets a pass because of choice value this game gives you no choices on the story side of things. Graphics are some of the best I seen though.;normal;English;8
Madrobot13;I won't get into the details as I'm sure you know all about it, but the PS4 version has way lest glitches than the PS3. This is up there with Ocarina of time and FF 7, Fallout 3, truly one of the best games out there.;expanded;English;10
Allion;By far the best game I've played. I enjoyed every second of it, and the multiplayer is actually quite fun and you can tell Naughty Dog put a lot of work into it.

edvinof;As i'm not a gaming veteran i can't really say this is the best game ever made, but it's by so far the best game i've ever played. Go play a match of Battlefield now feels like putting on an album by Blink 182 after an evening of  Stravinsky at the Met.;expanded;English;10

CaT-LiN_;The Last of Us: Remastered has top-notch presentation and voice-acting. The icreased framerate from 30 to 60 fps in this Remaster really helps the game out and the combat flows more organically compared to the PS3 version.,The gameplay consists of stealth, combat, crafting and exploring.,When exploring there is a chance for short conversations between characters to take place which are interesting and at times humerous. Stealth, combat and crafting unfortunately don't offer depth.,What follows from that is -I hate to say it- generic and shallow gameplay with no big variation betweeen segments. As good as the presentation, characters and their relationships are, we are talking about a video game that is lacking in the game aspect. On top of that it's hit or miss with the story itself. At times the game suddenly skips to the next season of the year, which can feel totally out of place and random.,,Usually I don't give a lacking game anything above a 6 but the qualities TLOU:R has bump it up to a 7.,Let's remember: just because it's SCEA top studio Naughty Dog doesn't mean everything is shiny and flawless,;normal;English;7
MASTERWHOPPER;Gaming perfection incarnate. Every PS4 player should play this once even if you already played it before this is still something to jump back into as it is just too good.;expanded;English;10
J_R_Taylor;The Last of Us was a true gem for the PS3, unfortunately it was let down by it's graphics and performance. With the remaster however, this game has got the upgrade that it deserves. While the changes may not be that noticeable in still images, it is definitely noticeable while playing. The game is a lot smoother and runs at an unlocked 60fps, this means that it can and will drop below that, but for the most part it remains smooth and the higher res textures are much more pleasing to the eye. Whether you are new to the game or you played it last gen, it's definitely worth picking it up for the PS4.;normal;English;10
Turbodowg;TLOU is one of those rare games that draws you in deep. It is a game that remains a part of you long after you have completed it. The deep, rich and emotional story is one of the greatest ever told in the history of gaming. Ellie and Joel are characters who you learn to feel for in a very human way by the end of the game. If games are considered art, then this is a prime example.,,The remastered version looks stunning and runs beautifully.,,The gameplay is as good as the first time I played. Level design is perfect, the controls and combat are fluent and feel realistic. Combat is brutal and gritty and every encounter feels like a struggle to protect your life and Ellie's. Enemies are intelligent and it takes some thought to progress (especially on first play through). The story encourages you to keep going to find out what happens next.,,The graphics are sharp and detailed. The scenery is stunning and vast. The addition of the DLC is worth the second purchase if like me you bought the ps3 version but not the DLC.The DLC is just as beautiful as the full game.,,If you have not already played The Last Of Us, I highly recommend it as one of the modern greats. This game will haunt you and be in every conversation about the greatest games for the rest of your life.,,I;normal;English;10

Munkey;The year 2014 was a bad year for games. Crapy AAA titles and cash grab HD/Remastered games. There is one good exception The Last of Us Remastered. The game was good on PS3 but the controls had some issues. Then comes the PS4 version in full HD/60 fps and the game is now perfect for me.,Improved and more responsive controls, better camera work and the graphics. The thing is the story and characters are the best part of this game. Joel and Ellie are a great duo. Written and executed perfect. The motion capture and voice acting is one of the best in games.,Post-apocalyptic world with zombie like enemies and human enemies who try to kill you and get your stuff. Game is grim and depressing at times but it feels real. Story is a great exploration on human morals, emotions and survival of the fittest.,One of the best games ever and for me the best game on PS4.,Ten out of ten!,,PS. With the Remastered version on PS4 you get the DLC Left Behind which is also very good! For the price this Remastered version is a bargain!;normal;English;10

mijxero;Firstly the storytelling and characters rate a 10.  This game evokes a lot of emotions and a lot of the scenes are very intense.  The stealth sections (which are very numerous) are very well done.  My only complaint is that gunfights felt a little awkward and the guns and their upgrades felt weak.  There were only a few weapons that really felt powerful.  Despite that it was hugely satisfying and was the best game I played this year.;normal;English;9
jallasbiro;I tried, and i tried,  but the gameplay is terrible, i hated it.  and for the story,  uhuuu using a young hottie and implying that he never wanted to have sex with her and stuff,  i think Freud would strongly disagree with the relationship between those two.  story is just weak and weird, and offering no controversy, it could been so much better if it wasnt writen by a old prick assuming that in real life it would go something like this.,,denying, denying, denying. when will it stop folks?;normal;English;0
Ocosu;This game honestly caught me by surprise. I wasn't even aware of this game. It was just something that came along in the bundle along with GTA5. I decided to toss this one in first. With no research what-so-ever, I went into it with an open mind. I wasn't expecting anything great, but that's exactly what I got. If you like games that actually require you to think a little, have amazing stories, and shooters, well? This is the game for you. I was completely blown away by this game and was very pleased with it. If I had known about this before, I would of been more excited about this game than I was of my GTA 5 game that came along with it. The fact they decided to toss this game into the bundle? I can't so much less but thank them!,,I'd highly recommend this game to anyone.;normal;English;10
JayLightBar;Now, being a person that completely hated Uncharted having it left a horrible taste in my mouth, seeing that this game played very much like that, I worried. However I'm glad to say that this game plays much better. Tighter aiming, a slew of crafting feature and a melee that works well. The game is a whole lot of fun. The story wasn't grand, but enjoyable for the most part. It wasn't as amazing as people made it out to be, and the ending is completely seen from a mile away. But the interesting characters throughout made it enjoyable. Sadly the game doesn't sport much of a soundtrack. Which to me kinda sucks. But was is it good? Hell yes. The best game on the ps4, even toping my previous favorite Alien Isolation.;normal;English;9
superfields;Never really played it on the PS3 but I was glad I did on the PS4, an achievement in story telling and gameplay this game is the staple for Sony replacing God of War I believe for years to come.,,I really look forward to the next one though most of the team got canned not sure what happened behind the scenes at SONY but if their recent email leaks give evidence they are a company in shambles right now.

ctn1187;Not sure what I can say. I saw how highly this game was rated by both users and critics. Although I wanted to play the game, I didn't think it could possibly be as good as everyone had said. From the moment the game started I was blown away. It felt like I was truly in this universe. The gameplay, the graphics, the story, all are top notch. Naughty Dog truly outdid themselves with this masterpiece. One of the few games that I have actually emotionally vested in and one of the few games that I truly felt satisfied after completion.,,As for the multi-player, it's not perfect. The campaign and overall game gets a 10/10. I'd probably give the multiplayer a 7/10. I think it is fun but it has some flaws. Again, that doesn't take away from arguably the greatest game I've ever completed.;normal;English;10
aVeng3ance;I've played this game both on PS3 and PS4. The suspense-filled gameplay and diverse environments are wonderful in themselves, but it is the emotional relationship that you develop with the characters that puts it above and beyond any game I've ever played. Not to mention that completing it on Grounded Mode was probably one of the most difficult single-player gaming experiences that I've ever been challenged with. The multiplayer is also fantastic, and I find myself playing it quite often (it's not just a one-off afterthought), and if you get a group of friends together, it is AMAZING;normal;English;10
Darkly_Tranquil;"Beautiful, brutal, shocking, and heartbreaking. These a just a few words I could use to describe what I regard as possible the best game I have played in more than 25 years of gaming. The Last of Us ticks all the boxes for a classic:,,[*] Graphics - All the characters are fully motion captured and move with a degree of fluidity and realism that I have rarely seen matched in other games. Aside from a few long distance textures, the backgrounds are exquisitely detailed, pulling you into the post-collapse world that the characters find themselves trying to navigate through.,,[*] Story - TLoU has one of the best written stories of a game I played, crafting characters who feel incredibly real and placing them within a decaying world setting that is both awful and plausible. While the core plot of the game has undoubtedly been done before, it has rarely, if even been executed with the nuance, pacing, style, and care as it has been here. If you care about story and character development in your games, TLoU hits it out of the park.,,[*] Music - The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack to the game, written by Oscar winning composer Gustavo Santolalla, perfect fits with the melancholy tone of the game as the characters struggle through the a world in which the remnants of human civilisation are slowly being reclaimed by the natural world. It is easily up there with the best videogame soundtracks ever written.,,[*] Voice Acting - Brilliant across the board, the voice cast of TLoU convey the grief, fear, despair, and hatred of the characters they inhabit, elevating their characters to a level of believability rarely achieved in the medium. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, as the voices of the two main characters, Joel and Ellie, carry the game of the strength of their exceptional performances and are, to my mind at least, the benchmark against which all other videogame voice acting will be measured.,,[*] Gameplay - If The Last of Us can be said to have any weakness, its that its gameplay is not as exceptional as every other facet of the game. The combat borrows heavily from Naughty Dog's other franchise ""Uncharted"", using third person melee and shooting combat, combined with a fairly simple stealth and crafting systems. While the combat is enjoyable, it remains fairly basic and does not have anything like the depth of the stealth action of something like Metal gear Solid. That said, it works well enough and keeps you sufficiently engaged to push the story along. The crafting mechanics are again, basic, but all the things you can make are useful and encourage you to think about what you will build and how you will use the finite resources you have at your disposal. But for all its limitations, the gameplay is never bad and doesn't detract from the overall experience, its simply not as outstanding as the rest of the package.,,Its rare that you can look at a game and say, ""This is a work of art"", but the The Last of Us is without a doubt one of those rare, exceptional games that transcends the limitations of its medium and achieves that lofty status. If you are a gamer who cares about storytelling in your games, TLoU is an unmissable experience in cinematic videogame storytelling and shows just what medium can do in the hands of truly skilled creators given the room by publishers to pursue their vision to its fullest potential.";normal;English;10

The online feels strategy based and rewarding.,,The only gripe. Naughty Dog continues to rip us off. They know we cant help buying ever little update that comes out so we have to pay for things like execution animations and scopes for guns we already have? Really Naughty Dog?

Finishing the game will leave you in awe and in my eyes are perfection. The online compliments the game even more as it's always interesting and challenging. There is a lot of teamwork online that leads to the success of your clan and possibly leading hundreds of people, as long as you can feed the mouths from doing well in fights.

electriclight41;While it has one of the best intros I've played in a while and is overall pretty entertaining, The Last of Us is horrendously overrated, especially when it comes to the story and dialogue. Seriously, how many F-bombs does a game need? It's distracting and unnecessary. The fact Ellie uses so many immediately takes away her innocence and frankly made me not care whether she died or not. The worst instance was during the giraffe scene, where she drops an F-bomb while petting one. Absolutely ridiculous.,,As for gameplay, it's pretty intense, but nothing I haven't seen before. I do like the upgrade system and the fact you never really feel like you're carrying enough ammo or supplies to be comfortable. The different locales are also refreshing and the voice acting is pretty good.,,Overall, it could have been way better. Still don't understand all the hype.

J-Nasty;As a person who has always loved these kind of games with a deep storyline along with stunning graphics on top of great voice acting, on top of great game play. The last of us delivers on all fronts. Putting it on next gen systems just adds more to an already amazing game. I fell in love with this game the minute it started with the first 10-15 minutes of game play it sucks you in and doesn't let you breathe until the final minute is played out. Easily one of the best games from start to finish that I have ever played, and quite possibly my favorite game of all time. Naughty Dog and writer Neil Druckmann deliver again and again. Can't say enough about it. Please do yourself a favor and get this game and play it. Has a decent replay value and it is a surprisingly long storyline that is not overly drawn out at the same time. Get this game!!!!!;normal;English;10

Salk;"The game cannot really be given a vote higher than 7 because it has 1 critical bug and several serious bugs, despite the updates/patches. The saving system is broken, with the autosave system overwriting the manual saves. The game hung once and the ragdoll physics is sometimes cause of ludicrous moments (like the bodies floating against gravity).,,The game's atmospheric and visually pleasing in the style of Naughty Dog's Uncharted series. There is good voice acting and characterization but in the end the gameplay mechanic doesn't break any new ground.,,I find the real and most satisfying way to play this game is at ""Grounded"" level where the distracting HUD and visual cues are banned, contributing immensely to the sense of danger and immersion.,,Excellent music score. Poor integration of friendly AI (the allies never really need to follow the same rules of the player and are never detected by enemies).";normal;English;7
The_Snari;My favourite game of all time is back with better graphics.

The only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 score is due to certain features that can be a tad annoying. That said, I am torn. If I were to give out a perfect score for 2014, it would go to The Last of Us Remastered. They certainly earned their glowing reviews.,,Pros,,- Stunning graphics. Literally breathtaking. I found myself staring at the horizon and trying to drink up every detail right from the start. Beautiful.,,- The storyline. The writing & dialogue is nothing short of genius and will quickly wrangle your interest. I felt thoroughly invested in the characters and the plot-line.,,- Mini-convos with Ellie/whomever is following you at the time feel real and immersive.,,- Even when fighting/sneaking Ellie will comment (whisper if you're sneaking) on the enemies or area or whatnot (it's specific too depending on who/what is after you.) It's difficult to explain why this is such a positive other than the fact it gives the game a realistic feel. Small details like this made a good game great.,,Cons,,- Listening mode no longer exists (which is fine it was rather OP & broke immersion a bit as I felt like it was a sci-fi ability) yet the tutorial still includes it. Also, increasingly listening mode's range is still an available upgrade for Joel despite the fact it has been removed. You have a limited number of pills (upgrade currency) & upgrades cannot be undone. However, Naughty Dog is usually excellent at patching things like this and I'd be surprised if this wasn't fixed soon. Still, beware.,,- The highest difficulty settings can be a bit frustrating. Not necessarily due to legit difficulty, but random things like being one shot less than a second after a cutscene can be frustrating. That said, only crazy masochists like my fiance play on those settings. :) For most, this won't be an issue.,,All in all, this is a game I would recommend for just about anyone looking to christen their PS4 or as a Christmas gift as all aspects of this game had excellent development. Combat. Story. Graphics. Three dimensional characters  with unique personalities. The Last of Us has it all.;normal;English;9

Another great thing is that you need and will use every weapon and item you have, instead of just picking them up and only use one throught the entire game.

It runs smoother, cleaner, and with an improved controller for the PS4 the game is just pure addicting. IF you HAVEN'T played TLoU yet, then this is the time to do so. Cheaper than the original, improved and including bonus content that costs just as much as the game normally. 10/10, it deserves the title of 2013 GOTY.;normal;English;10
slicksurfr;Amazing story, amazing graphics, surround sound and the best game I have played so far on the PS4. Highly recommended. Even better than the PS3 version.;expanded;English;10
blitzcomet;This game is near perfection, and I don't know why people are always hating on the gameplay, it's survival not Call of Duty, ammo is going to be scarce! Visuals are still amazing as ever, but better of course, its also much easier to play on the ps4 controller. Basically, if Naughty Dog made it then it's worth buying.;expanded;English;10
LNGames;Epic Game! This is no doubt one of the most dynamic game of this generation. Anyone who hasn't played The Last of Us, this is a must play. With over 100 awards, it is by far a contender for game of the year. The characters are amazingly developed, you actually want to learn more about them every minute of the game, with amazing development it makes the ideal story. Ellie is not your typical delivery mission, as the game goes on you actually don't wan't to get rid of her. One of the best stories I have ever seen, unfortunately at the end of the campaign they leave you hanging. That is why I hope they make a second one it will be just as good as the first. Bloody, brutal, and stealthy combat makes this the best combat in a game for a while, you even get to play as Ellie for some of the storyline which I had a lot of fun with that. Joel is not your typical 40 year old he is a total destroyer and you will have fun playing as him. All in all, if you have not played this game you must play it, one of Naughty Dog's finest masterpieces. Message to Naughty Dog: It would be awesome if you could make a 2nd game. 10/10 must play it ranks on my top game of all time!;normal;English;10
Vlad_Alucard18;This game is one of the best I've ever played. Really good graphics, good gameplay mixing stealth, action and gunfights.

thegraypelican;Great game. Love the stealthiness. Love the enemies. Love how you are vulnerable and no super hero. The side quest with the girl was a little silly to me. And the replay value isn't great. This game had me hooked though after I played for about an hour. Great story;expanded;English;9
mearlam;This is simply an amazing game in practically every way. It is a bit like uncharted or tombraider but a bit slower and no climbing. The game is a fairly slow paced game where you are walking rather than running around like a headless chicken. It is very story driven with film quality cut scenes and script so if you like to skip them I would avoid this.,,Pros:,,* Awesome story,* great tense action,* good leveling up system,* Amazing graphics,* varied guns,* pretty long story - 15+ hours,* good replay value -  finished it 3 times on ps3, once on ps4 so far,,Cons:,,* maybe a little bit hard at first - gets easier when you level up.,,Easily one of the best games ever made.,,I should say though that I do not play the multiplayer and have no interest in it. This should really be a single player only game so if you are looking for online action I would advise going elsewhere.;normal;English;10

Doutzen;"This game is overrated a little bit. I mean the story is really great, but also exaggerated, unnatural, unbelievable (I mean the relations part, not the zombie one, zombie is extremaly believable). This story is like Leo DiCaprio in Wolf of WallStreet - it wants to much to get the Oscar. And it's visible. I don't buy this melodramatic formula. It's cheap for me.,,Also the ""replayability"" is low, once you finish it, you never want it back.";normal;English;7
CallMePaul;Naughty dog strikes again. The last of us remastered is beautiful to look at and it retains all the great qualities of the previous version of the PlayStation 3. with the addition of the DLC telling Ellie story before she met up with Joel is very compelling and adds new detail and depth to the character. I could go on and on forever about this game and give a really long review. But, all that needs to be said is the game has great acting, a great story, Great gameplay, great sound design, great graphics, And it is an all-around Joy to play! It has its flaws, but none the take away from the game at all! Rightfully earns a 10 out of 10.;normal;English;10

Andred84;Are you ready to cry in HD? Very rarely comes a game with a thick story line that makes the player want to keep going (just like a Netflix binge), either trying to sneak around the infected, or go guns blazing when facing other hostile survivors, this game delivers on many aspects. The only trouble I find is that the game is a linear experience with the illusion of open world, although these components are executed well. With a replay mode that keeps all the perks you've fought hard to achieve (follows the old style of past survival horror games) and a fairly good multiplayer, amazing sound/score, this is a must have title for any type of player. Just get your box of tissues.;normal;English;9
DanDanReviews;"I am going to address right away why I think of this game as an ""8"" instead of a perfect ""10"", and the reason lies in the gameplay. I have always found zombie AI in video gaming to be dull, repetitive, and simple, and The Last of Us is not much different. While the story is very well told, I do not think I can give a game with such repetitive gameplay a perfect score. The game alternates between fighting humans, several different versions of the Infected (each with different strengths and weaknesses), and very annoying puzzles all concerning finding 2x4's for Ellie to float on because she cant swim. Repeat.,,This game is an experience, and hopefully a prelude to a gaming world that is more mature, but is by no means a perfect game.";normal;English;8

thejanraphaelbc;The best game made available for 1080p and 4K Television sets.,,One idiot sates that it was a waste of money because nothing changed one bit for the PS3 and PS4 versions. let me point out one thing = Remastered means an elevation in pixel count for a higher pixel density screen (Video). It is not a remake (a remake is game made in an entirely different visual and audio effects).,,So to those complaining that nothing changed for PS3 and Ps4 versions, change your TV and maybe you might notice the difference. This game was made for people transitioning from Xbox 360 to PS4 who would want to play the title.;normal;English;10
geofire;"Cliches are truisms, so I'll say it again: The Last of Us Remastered is a perfect game. Not only is the main story fun, evocative and terrifying, but the multiplayer is exciting and mature. If you enjoyed games like Resident Evil and/or Silent Hill for Playstation 1, you'll love this--which is why I described it as ""evocative"": it harkens back to a time when games were moody, thoughtful and ultimately very enjoyable. Plus the Remastered version looks amazing.";normal;English;10
Ecresis;Amazing story line, with the little extra in Left Behind DLC (included in the Remastered version). I'm not spoiling it but it's worth playing it, there are nice little moments in there. The AI could be better but it's a real challenge. The puzzles are a bit useless and too easy, probably not the best idea they had.,,Gameplay is good, you can lower the difficulty if you're not a pro, the missions are not repetitive, graphics are sensational on PS4, Ellie is adorable and Joel is .. well who cares, we're all here for Ellie aren't we ?,,Conclusion : you cannot miss this masterpiece, even if you're not pro at shooting on console;normal;English;9
endisni;This game is really superb.   It reminds me of Shadow Man on the N64.  The controls are very good, though a little hit and miss when needing to press the triangle action button.,Graphics are very impressive, the animation is excellent, but the sound is even better.  Music fades in and out at the right times, acting is better than any film I have seen recently and the whole ambience and feel you get from the game is thrilling.,If I could score this higher I would, only knocking off a point for the slight control issues, that really don't detract from this dramatic game that outclasses anything I have played since the most recent Tomb Raider on PS3.;normal;English;9
NanGamer;The Last of Us is one of the best games ever created in history. Naughty Dog is an expert at creating unforgettable experiences. But what is the purpose of this remastering? The game is absolutely the same as had been seen on the PS3. Obviously the 60 frames per second are welcome, but certainly the game is not worth it for those who already had the first experience on the PS3. For those who never played the game is a full plate. Do not get me wrong, The Last of Us for me is one of the best games of all time, but as 'remastering' is just a chance Sony profit a little more about this masterpiece.;normal;English;10
QwertyPJM;The Last of Us has ruined games for me. Since playing this masterpiece, nothing has come close to meeting the high expectations for narrative scope and world design that the developers Naughty Dog have set.,I'll begin with the one negative I can genuinely think of for this game: The weapon choice for the flamethrower seems a bit out of place and its inclusion towards the end doesn't really make sense. That's it. Pretty minor, and when the only criticism you have for a game is that there's a **** flamethrower in it, you know you're playing something pretty good.,Onto the positives:,1. The story, whilst it's been done a thousand times before, feels fresh, and you genuinely don't know where it's going at all. It's pacing is perfect, with massive, adrenaline fuelled bosses/set pieces juxtaposed with moments of tranquillity, just to explore the world. The way it's told doesn't miss a beat through it's 13-16 hour run time. An emotionally gripping tale topped with a somewhat bittersweet finale.,2.The world that's been crafted is one of the finest in all of gaming, as it portrays a barren society through its dilapidated buildings and overgrown vegetation whilst keeping the sense that this world was once inhabited. The areas you traverse are varied and interesting, encouraging exploration into every nook to discover another artifact that pieces the story together.,3. The characters are all very engaging, however the two that the story focuses on, two survivors brought together by circumstance, have an unmatched level of depth and chemistry. Their relationship grows and dwindles and breaks and reforms multiple times throughout the story, with the excellent voice acting and motion capture for these two making their trials and tribulations feel authentic. You want to root for these two, but at times you'll question whether you should.,4. The gameplay plays second fiddle to the story, however the immersion of the combat drags you deeper into the world by making you carefully craft items and hoard ammo from a limited amount of supplies found throughout the world. This makes you scavenge for more ways to survive, and also shapes the way you enter fights, with the constant danger of being without ammo always just one mistimed shot away. The human enemies encountered are standard, but the two main zombies (Infected as they're referred to) fought add terror and variety to proceedings. They make you use stealth, craft bombs and keep your distance because confronting them is so distressing. Action sequences are pulsating and nerve wracking at once, the way they should be.,5. The musical score is immense, nothing more to add.,6. The DLC is pretty awesome and adds an overall insight into one of gaming's best child characters, Ellie, as we see her touching yet inevitably tragic back story unfold.,7. The online multiplayer is more enjoyable than expected. Whilst I wouldn't buy the game solely for it, it offered a few more fun hours with the combat mechanics.,,To conclude, The Last of Us is the best game I have ever played. It's gripping, heartbreaking, eye opening and stunning all at the same time. A masterpiece, a game that hopefully proves what impact video games can have on the entertainment medium. Play it right now.;normal;English;10

JaydogReviews;The Last of Us Remastered is the best game I have ever experienced, and no doubt in my mind the best game out on the Ps4 right now.

jacobstone4;"Okay first off let me clarify that my actual score is more like an 8.7 rather than a nine. The Last of Remastered bring everything the original had back with that little graphical kick for the PS4 has to offer. (I.E. the giraffe scene) It's a fantastic video game with a beautiful well written story and ultimately fantastic conclusion that is something only Naughty Dog themselves can pull off. Now some of you may wonder why I praise it so much but only give it an 8.5. Well I will tell you right now in three simple words....immersion breaking A.I. It happens quite often to me at least. I am getting immersed so deep playing on grounded mode, hiding from clickers or hunters and then boom Ellie dips out of cover clearly in front of them and for a split second I am screaming at her but then I remember that they can't ""see"" Ellie. It totally broke my immersion even if its only for a minute its still something that deeply bothers when playing such a tense game. Now the sections where you play by yourself (without an A.I. companion) are by far some of the most tense sections I have ever encountered in a video game period. Well that is the single player because I don't want to spoil anything for those select few who still haven't played it yet for some odd reason. Now the multiplayer which also docks some critical points off this review. The multiplayer is very straight simple but in the best way possible. It is fun and can keep you attached for hours on end....at least until your ""group"" gets wiped out because of the stupid metagame Naughty Dog decided to put in for some odd reason. I mean come on multiplayer is about having fun but with this metagame its almost like you have this little thing in the back of your head saying ""Be the best"" which for me at least takes away part of the fun because I feel pushed to ""try hard"" every game and be number on the boards when i should just be having fun. But survivors is one of the tense multiplayer games I have played yet, far more tense than Search and Destroy on Call of Duty. Anyway these two negatives aside the positives far outweigh the negatives in this game and I would highly recommend to anyone who has the slightest thought of picking it up. I restate my score of an 8.5 and will add its one of the best looking Playstation 4 games for the console right now.";normal;English;9
deandusk;Masterpiece. Both technical and artistical. From the great visuals, to the great, lively characters, to the unforgiving but greatly rewarding gameplay, which makes you feel human: with no superpowers, resources are scarce, and you always have to think of a strategy in order to survive. From the perfectly coherent (though by no means original) storyline, to the fancy soundtrack, it alls comes to serve the superb unity and uniquness of this game. It's not a fast paced game, but by god, it's so deep, why should it be fast?,P.S..: In the light of the recently release of blockbusters that are given to the poor, honest gaming community as public betas (expemsive, mind you! And yes, I am talking about AC Unity), this game shows us that it can be done right, no annoying bugs and glitches, no feeling of unpolished gameplay etc. Thank you, devs of Naughty Dog!;normal;English;10
Broofist;Watch 8 hours of zombie classics instead.  The gameplay and story are completely average, press x or press triangle and a little script is executed.   No timing or motor skills.  The plank moving is unnecessary and frustrating.  This fits nicely into the new style of games which play out like a long cut scene interrupted by brief flashes of simple combat.  It looks good on the ps4, but unfortunately is a boring, quick, and linear playthrough.;normal;English;4
TSapper;PS3 version was one of the best games of 2013 (Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider beat it for me).  I had hopes for the PS4 version to shine ... but was disappointed. The 'remaster' didn't change much including graphics.,If you played it on PS3, don't bother with this one. If you did not, then definitely get this game.  Would score a solid 8 if a new game.;expanded;English;6
Break;"All I am focusing on is the graphics, because it is a remaster so I cannot justify the gameplay, story or the mechanics. It is a pretty beautiful game. The colours pops out beautifully and the visuals are fan-f**kingtastic    . I have never seen a game this graphically awesome. The only thing I don't like about the game is the AI system. The AI is extremely clunky at times, sometimes they don't know where you are at, stuck near a wall and stuff like that. The enemy AI is quite dumb, even on HARD mode. They also have the same problem with the allies, too, some of which that could spoil the whole game. Stealth still okay at least. Without the AI problems, it would have been a perfect game, but still, if you want to get red eyes (good thing) when you see the graphics, i have to recommend this game for you, even when you have played the original. This game will have you saying "" WOW LUK AT DEM GRAFIKS M9!!!!"" for hours to come. Conclusion: BUY.";normal;English;8

masterhoodwinke;Fantastic single player, that part is clear to most.  I'm really here to explain just how good this multiplayer is!  It's almost like a hybrid post apocalyptic Gears of War.  Its really fantastic, I play quite a few multiplayer FPS and this one has a special place in my gaming heart. Its tactical and utterly intense yet still flows with an expert control scheme.  I love the item crafting mid match and the limited ammo forces players to think outside the box.,,Hopefully Naughty Dog makes a another Multiplayer game this good in the future.;normal;English;10
v0nd3;"Played On: Hard,,While The Last of Us delivers a superb story, it's held back by some questionable gameplay mechanics that seem to keep it from being an entirely satisfying experience. More often than not, the game forces players into combat situations that feel arbitrarily set in place. While sneaking past enemies is certainly a mainstay in the game, at times it will throw unexpected enemies at the player that cannot be avoided, forcing a fight.,,While this wouldn't be such an issue in certain other games, it does take one out of the seriousness of the story itself when you are forced to have Joel run up and brawl several enemies to death. This, mixed with the lack of ammo one will find later on (despite the fact you can stealth kill individuals who are equipped with fully loaded guns and they drop nothing) ends up making the game feel like a brawl-a-thon which is clunky and boring.,,Mechanics aside, the story is what really shines through. While the overall story arc itself isn't particularly unique or interesting, what makes the game are the characters. Ellie is perhaps one of the best female leads in a video game in history, while Joel, often called ""Tex"" by his partner earlier in the story, really sells the hard-ass survivor, and his character arc is one of the best I've seen in recent media story-telling. However, a chapter near the middle that starts off interesting begins to feel as if it demands too much time for too little pay-off, with its finish eliciting a sigh of relief rather than a fond farewell.,,Overall, while the story itself is quite enjoyable, primarily the characters themselves, it begins to drag in one of the middle chapters before picking up once again in the next, and the gameplay mechanics begin to feel like a detriment rather than a benefit half-way to three-quarters of the way through it. This, mixed with an ending sequence that felt too fast and easy, leaves one realizing that the greatness of this game isn't in its gameplay.";normal;English;8

revrevolution;I almost forgot to leave a review for this game. I never played The Last of Us on the PS3, because I didn't own one. Fortunately, I had my chance with the Remastered version on the PS4, and I absolutely loved it. Through and through, Naughty Dog creates a masterful story with very solid gameplay that keeps you on your toes and makes you think before you act. This is especially important in the multiplayer, which offers a very nice change of pace compared to the traditional CoD shooter title. Exclusive to the Remastered version is the ability to run the game at 60fps. It might seem like a picky detail, but swapping between the locked 30fps and then changing it back to 60, I couldn't imagine playing the game any other way. Great game that deserves a lot of credit, and should be a part of any Playstation owner's library.;normal;English;9

Kenophobia;The Last of Us: Remastered returns with one Naughty Dog’s most critically acclaimed titles in beautiful 1080p with included DLC.  But, does The Last of Us: Remastered warrant purchase on Sony’s next-generation, or was it best left untouched and in the past?,,While I never experienced The Last of Us on PS3, I was able to spend about 100+ playing The Last of Us: Remastered on PS4 in both singleplayer and multiplayer game modes.  The Last of Us: Remastered is one of the most brilliant singleplayer stories ever created, and despite being set in an already overpopulated post-apocalyptic survival genre, does an excellent job of distinguishing itself as a truly remarkable title. The singleplayer story will have you on the edge of your seat throughout its entirety as Naughty Dog puts you through an emotional rollercoaster of events set in the not so distant future. Threats lie around every corner, and you will be challenged on even the easiest of difficulty settings.  However, while The Last of Us: Remastered delivers an exceptional experience in terms of its singleplayer, the same cannot be said for the multiplayer.  While the multiplayer gametypes deliver a rather refreshing and unique variant on the third person shooter, they fail to provide what could have been a defining feature of the title. The multiplayer component of the game is plagued by network issues, incomplete balancing, and DLC pay-to-win microtransactions that prevent players from enjoying the multiplayer as it could have been.  However, the shortcomings of The Last of Us: Remastered multiplayer should not prevent anyone from purchasing it, as the game is truly a testament to what singleplayer should be in videogames. Naughty Dog truly delivered one of the most influential and memorable gaming experiences, and I hope that this IP becomes one of Naught Dog’s flagship franchises alongside the Uncharted series. If you have already played The Last of Us on PS3, you might want to pass on the Remastered version, but if you have never played the title, I highly recommend you make this part of your collection.;normal;English;9

You become emotionally attached to every character especially the main ones. The graphics throughout are very special and every detail is there to even the smallest things such as leaflet writing. The gameplay is fantastic with smooth slick controls and an easy to use interface.

I can say quite happily that it was worth it, I loved everything about this game and it was entertaining enough that my partner watched me play through it. I strongly recommend this to anyone that likes a bit of everything in their game.;expanded;English;9
jstanothergamr;By now, everyone has heard why this game is great... and it is a very solid game.  However, at a full $60, the remastered version is not worth the price (unless you have not played it of course). If this was $40 I'd give it a 9.,However-,-the remastered graphics have actually taken away from the dark and brooding atmosphere of the game.  Everything is too crisp and clean now.,- there's a graphical draw-distance issue that wasn't present in the original,-the multiplayer seems to have more bugs and issues than the original PS3 version,-not only are you paying $60s again, but if you want the new special guns you have to pay for them with more money - if you don't pay for them, then someone will have a leg up on you in multiplayer,,As someone who spent $80 dollars on the original + the season pass, this feels like a 'cash grab.';normal;English;7
LG045;"I bought this game for the ps4 and didn't know what to expect from it.I wasn't familiar with the game or the story. In the beginning i was a bit sceptical playing it but further way i really just wanted more. The graphics are stunning, the story is great, you really get in touch with the characters. I have just finished the ""normal"" story mode and i can't wait to do the rest of the remastered edition. If you are thinking about buying/playing this game i highly recommend it! For me, this is the best game on the ps4 at the moment.  I really like to see that Naughtydog makes a sequel after this.";normal;English;10

metacritic3012;One of the best games I have ever played on the PS4. Great story and superb graphics. This is survival horror at its best. Can not wait for the sequel!!;expanded;English;10
Sploolordcam;"I should start by saying I'm not a fan of the model to remaster a year old game and sell it full-price, but I'll leave that judgement out of my score. This version is a strong upgrade in performance from the original. It boasts an impressive 1080p and 60fps with increased draw distance. The assets themselves are somewhat enhanced too. Most of the DLC is included with this release as well. For those looking for cinematic, almost movie-like games, this is a must play. The gameplay is nice and having to manage your limited ammo and inventory is a nice survival horror staple which works well here. The impact of melee fighting in the game feels great as well. This game truly shines in its story, while it doesn't do anything new for storytelling (which is terribly difficult to accomplish in the over-saturated ""zombie"" genre), it does play cliches straight through impressive writing and dialogue. Overall this is a nice enhancement for a great game, but would likely not be worth a full-price buy for people who already own the PS3 version.";normal;English;8

I actually loved watching the cutscenes.,I never played the PS3 version, so my first experience with this game has been as the 1920 remaster.,Some of the best graphics I've seen, playable beyond expectation.,Naughty Dog went way above and beyond with this one. I had played Uncharted and never really got into that series. It was...ok. This is not Uncharted. It's a whole different beast.,The characters are really well developed, you feel for them.,I absolutely loved the score, composed by the brilliant Gustavo Santaolala, who I know from his work on several films.,I like where this is going, bringing gaming closer and closer to the overall cinematic story telling experience.;normal;English;10
Sebat4;This is one of the best game I have played in recent years. It always keeps me in a huge suspense and when I have played it in the middle of the night it actually freaked me out. The game isn't perfect and has its cons but I still love it. Graphics are beautiful and the idea of the game is just plain fun. From killing mutated people to killing actual people who are trying to kill you and rub you, to just running away and hiding or crafting weapons/med kits/bombs. Different things and the most enjoyable 3rd person view I have played in a long time.;normal;English;10

MiseryPS4;"As for the game The Last Of Us, my impressions are very positive. To begin with, the game is not a typical representative of a post-apocalyptic shooter or action games, the game is a mix of dashed hopes of a man, as of one, and the whole of humanity, inner feelings of each character, in this case, the depth of suffering different people entirely depends on the nature of that excellent tracks in the game, and in the end, great gameplay, controls and setting. I lowered the game by one point estimate for a fairly controversial ending in terms of ""good"" humanity, if it can be called so, and some strange moments in the game that you can just ""run"". As for the version for next-generation consoles, it is awesome. Fps consistently high, graphics and textures are on a very good level. Overall: great remake of one of the best exclusives of the past generation, and certainly the game, which can not be passed by anyone, ever. Ranked # 9 of 10.";normal;English;9

Lodge1960;An astonishing game. One of the very few games actually made for adults. And I don't mean your average 14 year olds concept of adult, i.e. lots of nudity and violence. It certainly does contain plenty of the latter, but by adult I mean  a proper emotionally based story where the characters change and evolve as it unfolds. This dynamic shift in the protagonists relationship is subtly played out through their interactions. A testimony to the story telling is that at the start of the game Joel really hasn't much time for Ellie at all and at one point is in two minds whether to just abandon her. However, by the end he is willing to sacrifice a possible cure for mankind to save her life. Due to the craftsmanship of the subtle story telling the player completely and utterly understands and sympathises with his action. I also like the non-stereotypical portrayal of a gay man. Well done Naughty Dog.;normal;English;10
pjosephson;I have to reiterate, like most people have said, the story is awesome.  However, I hate when people give things a 10.

FrenchToast;TLOU is an extremely pretty game. It does enough to separate itself from its PS3 counterpart to warrant a second purchase. This package includes the Left Behind expansion and all multiplayer DLC. The story is incredible. There are twist and turns and you never really know what will happen next. I found myself having no idea when the game would end!. The intro is extremely emotional. The game takes hold there and never lets go although the first 30-1:00 after that are extremely boring. Once you get through that it is a great game. The visuals are stunning. Combat requires carefully planned strategy and execution. The gunplay feels a bit clunky at first after upgrading Joel and acquiring more powerful weapons it feels right at home. The zombie AI is frustrating but not intelligent. It will get cheap shots on you more times than you can count and getting killed by a clicker (a powerful zombie that  can instakill you if it gets close) sometimes these aren't fair and restarting an area with them over and over again gets tiresome. The same can't be said for human enemies. They are extremely smart. They will find ways to get around you and attack you from behind. Fighting a group of enemies at once is extremely stressful and nerve wracking. The locations throughout the story are varied and beautiful. The last section of combat in the story is tiresome and a low point. Crafting requires thinking as things like health packs use the same equipment as molotovs.,The multiplayer is great and puts a new spin on stealth gameplay. It requires careful coordinating with other players. It has an extremely steep learning curve. My best advice is move slow and stick with your teammates. The crafting interface works well here and the maps fit in nicely. The left behind DLC is good but not as much as the main story line. Overall this is a fantastic game with only minute issues.;normal;English;10

twc004;Next to Shadow of Mordor, this is the best game on PS4 right now. It is a lot of fun and makes you feel fully immersed into this convoluted world.

daringo5;"After seeing all the review sites and shows giving this game awards, I finally decided to pick it up on the ps4. What a big mistake and waste of money that was......  I was expecting some amazing storyline with amazing gameplay but that is not what this game is at all.,Gameplay is the most annoying thing I have ever felt when playing a game. The stealth aspect is so broken... you spend 90% of the time sneaking past enemies - then at the last moment get spotted by a clicker or infected, then get bitten on the neck because this game has no real weapons whatsoever, and have to end up doing it all over again. There seems to be millions of bricks laying around but no weapons at all.,There is no point even having a gun in this game as ammo is so scarce. Consider yourself lucky if you have 6 units of ammo in your inventory! Also another joke in this game is that in other games where we actually have something called a ""Knife""  in this game they expect us to keep making our own shivs, and the only way to take down some enemies is to sneak up and shiv them.. what a joke...... Surely we come across so many allies in the game and someone is bound to have a knife.,The storyline is cliche. Same old story of town getting infected by zombie virus and you fighting for survival. The only good thing is the voice acting in the game but thats about it.,The graphics are not ground breaking either... Im surprised seeing people go on about how amazing the graphics are, but they just look average in my opinion. People seem to be getting excited over its ability to render at 60fps at 1080p, but whats the point? seeing as the gameplay is lacking 100% in this. Also the game puts you in smaller environments where draw-distance is not required, so its bound to have a higher frame per second..,I would not recommend anyone to buy this game, especially at full price. Worth a rental just to see what all the fuss is about, but to buy and own would not be worth it.";normal;English;1
MisterBirdy;One of the finest games I have ever played.  The campaign is compelling, human and exhilarating. The characters develop and their relationships grow.  It strikes the perfect balance of exploration and shooter.    It is a game for adults with a mature morality and believable world. A great stride forward for those of us who are waiting for video games to quit catering solely to teenagers.,What is more, the multiplayer is the rare shooter that rewards strategy and can be enjoyed by a novice without having to spend an absurd amount of time.;normal;English;10

Batfinkskinner;Its the same seminal game it was before but with the spit, polish and  performance improvements that make it a must have if you haven't dipped your toe in its spore riddled waters. However, if you played it to death on the ps3 you may feel the familiarity cloud the visual/performance upgrades but its still worth picking up.

davidgoliath;Yes this game is very good, verging on excellent.. It is also hyped up to the max, best game ever it simply is not (for me anyway)(storyline yes).,,Lets start with the good, of which there is a lot. Gameplay is genuinely engrossing and challenging, I haven't played the game on the easier settings, starting off on the hardest, and some areas are really tough. You have to conserve and choose when to use ammo etc. The game is very atmospheric (graphically too), sometimes chilling.. It actually scared the **** out of me a couple of times!,,Combat and shooting is quite tough, upgrading is essential.. the AI of the enemies is ok, not brilliant, but they don't all just run and gun. Stealthing is really fun, taking out enemies slowly and tactically is much more rewarding than trying to gun everyone down, although how Ellie doesn't get you discovered!,,Onto the storyline, the famous storyline... Yea its amazing! I really did go though this game with a genuine connection to the characters, it's hard not to be empathetic.., i won't go into too much detail, i'm sure you already know. I replayed this game straight after i finished because I enjoyed it so much.,,So why not a ten? Simply because for me a game has to be perfect to get a ten.. i guess for me perfect means I play a game for months without getting bored,.. hence why games like Guitar Hero (yes!) and Halo are better, for me personally.. I suppose it depends on what your priorities are.. A perfect game fom me has to be at its core, addictive and fun to play for many, many weeks if not months. The Last Of Us is addictive for a little less time. I put this on a par with the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic games which i absolutely loved for story/gameplay/graphics, but got a little less replayability.,,Still in my top ten favourite games ever!;normal;English;9

TheCartoon77;The Last of Us Remastered is perhaps the most frustrating game I've seen this year not because of the combat or characters or story or anything in the game itself for that matter. Just how much attention and praise its gotten for being the same game but prettier and on a different system. TLOU is a good game, no doubt about it. The combat is flawless and executed perfectly in every way. Not to get ahead of myself here, but the combat is actually, in my opinion, is as sleek and satisfying as the Batman games. The characters are relatable and none of them are irritating or arbitrary in any way. The game has its eyes on cinematic side to games, just like Uncharted. It pulls it off nicely and thanks to the graphics makes cut scenes look like a Blu-Ray film, and the gameplay look like a work of interactive art. If there's one thing TLOU slips up on is the story progression. As in the places the characters go to seems a little too convenient or pre-determined a lot of the time. For example, in one section of the game you meet someone who just so happens to be a friend of the main character AND a mechanic to get them out of there as well as a car mechanic too.,,This game is recommended and does deserve the praise it gets despite the fact the people who get this for a second time on PS4 are unmistakably going to be playing the same game again. Not that there's a problem with that.;normal;English;7
Mistval;"This is the best single player game I've played since my Nintendo days, and I don't think I've ever felt so much for video game characters. The voice actors and writers did a terrific job, but what I think is even more impressive is the body language in the cutscenes. The artists did an unbelievably good job capturing all the nuances of human interaction.,,The gameplay itself always kept me on the edge of my seat, I always felt like I was in danger. Playing this game you quickly learn that something bad is always going to happen ""soon"", but you don't know what ""soon"" means. Some not-particularly scary places explode in your face while you're walking through, while sometimes dark buildings where you're sure a horde of zombies must be hiding, are actually empty. Caring about the characters amplifies this sense of danger. Even though dying has no major consequences, I still felt I desperately had to avoid it.,,To some extent, this is a stealth game. You will have a much easier time if you try to take out enemies quietly - or even sneak right past! For most part the stealth mechanics are pretty good. There was never a time when an enemy magically saw through a wall or something like that. On the other hand, the enemies can be amazingly oblivious to you sitting behind a crate with your head poking up above it. Or they will look right at you and shine a flashlight in your face, except you're like a hundred feet away and they can't see that far.,,Shooting mechanics are good and feel very realistic. Ammo is scarce so you find yourself taking careful aim and swearing when you miss.,,This game is very linear. Naughty Dogs is telling a story here, and it's NOT a story about the player, it's a story about Joel and Ellie. The two of them make monumental decisions with zero input from the player. You are guided by the environment from point A to point B along a pretty narrow path. It is common in such games that they are not very replayable. This is true here, too. While I did love playing through this game, I probably will not play the main story again, at least not for quite a while. The main story took me 12 hours to beat. After that you can try it on higher difficulties or look for collectible items and such if you're into that.,,Online multiplayer is actually pretty cool and I don't know of any other online games quite like it. It's pretty slow paced and tactical so you must be patient. There's a lot of hiding and creeping around and trying to get the angle on each other. Sadly, not that many people play it. The only gripe I have is that I wished they left out the ""listen"" ability that lets you see nearby, moving enemies through walls. It weakens the stealth aspect.,,They did an excellent job upgrading the graphics. I would not have guessed that it is a remastered PS3 game. It does seem like they missed a couple of spots, though. I remember being in a sewer and there were some chains attached to this grate so it could be lifted by pully. Except the chains weren't shaped like chains, they were clearly boxes with chain links painted on them.,,All in all if you don't have this game on your shelf, you're doing it wrong. Fix that!";normal;English;9

tadasbub;"Very good, but quickly gets old and boring.,There is a wonderful line connecting this game start to finish - an aging man years ago lost everything, including his teenage daughter who was killed, gets to relive fatherhood feelings while having to take care of and protect the girl he has to take across the country. The storyline if modified is probably worth a movie at some point down the road, but as far as gameplay it gets repetitive and old very fast - you run around, collect items, shoot and kill zombies, infected, military, etc.. while going from point A to point B in a predefined path. There is no open world concept really, it is almost like you are playing a on-rails-shooter with some degree of flexibility how to kill your enemies. It gets boring, the level of complexity in ""puzzle solving"" is sad, and is better left to 1st graders (Don't, because it is not a game for kids...), lack of different paths in gameplay, or decision-consequence in the game is an eye-sore. Some tasks could be time-limited, outcomes of your ""faith"" or difficulty of the path chosen may depend on which door you open, which path you  take around city/your surroundings, items found, information you collect could depend on ""friends"" (and there are not many...) you make, there is so much more that could have been done to make game interesting.,,It is visually beautiful, story is good, but that is where it ends. I am torn, to give it better or worse rating, because there are worse games that get better ratings, but to be fair, 6 is just about right given high expectations and hype that is created.

griffey546;"*READ THE REVIEW BEFORE YOU CRITICIZE IT*,,The game has been always said to be a masterpiece, and I truly never understood why.  When playing, i kept hoping for a game sort of like uncharted, as it was made by the same company, but all I got in my experience was sneaking around, picking up ladders, placing those ladders dow, and climbing up them.  The Last of Us felt more like a movie, you couldn't go more than 5-10 minutes before walking into a cutscene, and even between those cutscenes had no action, the only action going on took place in the cutscenes.  Getting into a cutscene was like rolling the dice, no action in the cutscene, no action in the game, action in the cutscene, well you've got a 50% chance of actually having a thrill in the game.  A little tip to those people who want this game, I'd recommend you just buy a movie instead, you save yourself the money.  You can even search up on places such as YouTube, ""The Last of Us Full Movie"", and that shows you everything that happens in the game, as they don't even need to try hard to even get rid of the gameplay, as there really is NO gameplay.";normal;English;5
Soulblighter;IMO the best PS3 game with upgraded resolution and frame rate. Great campaign and addicting multiplayer mode for those who like to use strategy and cooperate with teammates rather than run and gun.;expanded;English;10
CosmotheSloth;With all the hype surrounding this game, and the talk of a film being made, I was worried then when I finally got to play 'The Last Of Us' it would be another AAA flop. How wrong I was.,,The gameplay itself is a standard 3rd person shooter mechanic, however, in this game there is a large emphasis on stealth and, like a true survival horror style game should do, you feel the need (on many occasion) to avoid contact with the enemy to save your valuable supplies for another, possible harder, encounter. This level of tension and immersion is one that I have never truly experienced with any other game (possibly my attachment to my squad in the final mission of Mass Effect 2) and it's this that takes TLoU to another level of gaming.,,The script and voice acting is sublime which aids with the immersion even further. The atmosphere (music, sound effects, lighting, etc.) of this world created by Naughty Dog is set wonderfully and the gameplay is fluid, effective and exciting. The gameplay is one I would describe as easy to learn - hard to master, which is the kind of gameplay that is few and far between nowadays. The game overall, can be quite difficult, especially for someone of a short attention span who would rather run and gun, but if played correctly, is incredibly rewarding and intense.,,The characters are not only likable but lovable and really make you feel as if you're part of the game. There were parts of the game when I would be shouting at the TV for Ellie or Joel's sake.,,Although having a PS3 when TLoU was release originally, I decided to wait for the game to be rereleased on PS4. Whilst this was probably a good choice with regards to the visuals, I noticed a few glitches that I assumed wouldn't have been present in the original version such as enemies running in circles, falling through the map, and dying instantly when getting stuck on a ledge. However, none of these ruined my experience of the game.,,In addition, DLC and multiplayer actually add to the game for once. The multiplayer is good fun and well built and balanced which is something I wasn't expecting. The DLC builds up the back story and fills in the gaps as brilliantly as the game told the original story.,,All-in-all, TLoU is an experience. An experience that you should not deprive yourself of having. I gave this game a 10/10, not because the game is flawless, but because I haven't enjoyed a game this much for a very long time (and I don't see me doing so for a long time in the future), and in an industry that is awash with repetitive, recycled, bland AAA titles, The Last of Us is a nice reminder that games have the potential to be as brilliant as any other art form.;normal;English;10

dangerfar;"Though it seems fairly inconsequential to offer up another option about a game which has had so much written about it in the last year, my perspective is perhaps a bit different than the status quo and thus will offer it. Many reviewers have called this game a masterpiece, of which the 'remastering' simply further elevates its masterpieceness.,,There are 2 areas which I agree The Last of Us is truly extraordinary: characterization and graphical flexibility. Note I didn't say story and graphics, because these paint a large swath over many attributes in which The Last of Us is merely good or perhaps even average.,,There may never have been characters like Joel and Ellie in a video game. If there have been I don't believe I've played it. The facial expressions, motivations, voice acting, and dialogue between them is that of a good movie or TV show. Not a great movie or TV show, but a good one, and that is enough to set it in a league of its own in the video game realm. They are the anchors of the game and without them this game is lost. Everything is built upon their relationship to each other and to the world, and it is executed beautifully.,,Perhaps you were wondering about that second extraordinary characteristic, ""graphical flexibility"" (I'll admit I perhaps just made that up). What I mean by that are moments of truly great presentation that by all accounts would have appeared to be a pre-rendered scene if it weren't for the fact that you just caused it to happen. For instance, say you're in the midst of a zombie horde and out of bullets and decide it's time to give them a good thrashing with your trusty baseball bat. You start to hit them and the camera reacts and Joel's movements look so natural it truly does look right out of a movie. Or if a ""clicker"" gets the better of you and bears into your neck another cut-scene arises that purely originated from your actions. I marveled at these over and over at these thinking something would be messed up, something would be out of place or someone's motions would appear out of place. That never happened. Every time it felt completely real. They've tapped something here that if it could be expanded upon and continued will add a tremendous amount to absorption in a game.,,Now for the rest of it. Well the rest of it is good, if not forgettable. The graphics are solid for sure, good lighting and textures, nothing that hasn't been done before but certainly they are pretty. The story aside from the characters isn't terribly original. There's some interesting twists, but overall there's not much here to separate from the other thousand zombie stories floating around. The gameplay is a bit dull. If you've played any of the Uncharted series you'll likely know their shooting mechanics aren't exactly top shelf, and the solitary puzzle element of finding a ladder or something to jump on isn't terribly riveting. The best moments of combat come from when you run out of bullets and are down on your luck, and have to sneak white knuckled around tons of people who want to kill you.,,Speaking of that, I'll go off on a bit of a tangent and say I'm disappointed (and truthfully not for the first time) that a game that really tries to be realistic and suck you in has tons of people just walking around doing nothing but apparently looking for you without any good reason. The zombies make sense I guess, I wouldn't think they would have daily objectives, but truth be told most of your enemies in this game are comprised of humans who just patrol around dumbly with apparently no purpose in life but to kill people who happen to wander around them. They might as well be zombies themselves. I would have loved to catch some people actually doing something, some tense interactions where you had a bit of a stand off or something. Or at least give me a better reason for them wanting to kill me with such zealotry.,,Anyway, the gameplay isn't very exciting. In fact, I found it so dull I simply stopped playing the game for a long period of time. Eventually I came back and was drawn in enough to finish it, but it sure wasn't the thrill of the hunt. It was Joel and Ellie. They're the heart of the game, and they're a glorious heart indeed. Them with what appeared to me to be a technical breakthrough with aspects of graphics was enough to keep me going. But it did feel tedious at times, and truthfully just wasn't much fun.";normal;English;7

Like being stuck in the black loading screen. Or when you and your friends would not be on the same team even though you were on the same party. But once you are passed with the negativity which likely wont happen as often anymore. This is where Last of Us truly shine. With the emphasis on team work, playing smart and together with the crafting mechanics it has made this game truly one of a kind online multi-player experience.,,Would recommend this game to anyone that has never played it on the PS3 and as for PS4 owners, you might to get it if you are really into the Online Faction mode since the crowd is still going strong.;normal;English;10
Ecto1;When the game came out on PS3, I didn't think much of it. Sure it was NaughtyDog, but zombie survival games just are not my type of game. But after my brother bought it on his PS4 and let me give it a play, I must say that I'm stupidly surprised at what The Last of Us actually is. Its the story of two characters slowly growing together in a world that's been torn apart.,,I wont say anything else about the games story as I don't want to spoil it in any way. but other than that, the graphics are not the best on PS4, but its clean, sharp, runs beautifully and still retains NaughtyDogs sense art.,,The perfect remastering of a game that I would not have thought about playing for any other reason than it being from NaughtyDog has found its way into my PS4 library as a near perfect game.;normal;English;10

On the downside I thought the death of the main antagonist was kind of weak. 9.5/10,,Second, the attack/hide game play was pretty fun. The amount of ammo and weapons you use the finish the chapter won't be there next time, so use your ammo wisely. You must use stealth to alter the overwhelming odds against you, but the actual AI in the game were kind of stupid. If you turn on your flash light on zombies won't notice you, which doesn't make any sense. While in stealth mode your support runs out in front of the enemy to hide without being seen. 5/10;normal;English;8
sacredbear;The Last of Us' well written script masks its very tedious and repetitive gameplay.  The game works like this:  you kill zombies, you kill people.  Rinse, repeat.

Andye82;I don't think that the graphics are THAT much better than on ps3 and sometimes they even look more artificial now with some fancy hair flowing technology. Single player is excellent story wise and the music just gives me the chills. However as it's not so long time since I completed the game on ps3 I am a bit bored to play it again. Especially since now it's easy to notice how stupid the enemies are.,However I the real gem here is the factions multiplayer. I never played it on ps3 but now I am hooked. It is clever and it's very strategic game. Never before has team play been so crucial. Go solo and you die,  simple as that. If your team plays as a team you have a good chance of winning. If your team runs around you will be slaughtered. Really underrated multiplayer, it's better than destiny or bf4.;normal;English;9

Yes it's linear, so if that's not your thing, fine. But to say it's a terrible game is just plain ignorance and those reviews should not be taken seriously. It is an excellent game, one of the best of this generation and greatly remastered on PS4. I'm on my 4th play though it and still not bored yet.,,To all the wannabe critics on here who think this game is worth a zero, there is a reason you're job isn't to be a critic.

CamLuke;With a game like The Last Of Us it is extremely hard to sum up in a short review.  One word that can describe it would be Masterful.  Its game play engine being similar to that of Uncharted and Tomb Raider you can tell that this game is an instant win.  The story delivers to you one that goes in depth like The Walking Dead: Season One but is action packed instead of a point and click.  You get a feeling as if the characters are living people and you feel emotion for them. When I completed the game I felt as if i were saying goodbye to two best friends.  Ellie and Joel.

Deusex;Finally got the chance to play this game. And it is what of thought it be. Is it a bad game? No. But is it great? Not close. It's a good game that's for sure.,Pros:,Atmosphere- it feels all too real. The survival feeling is true. Scavenging ammo during shoot outs whilst taking cover is intense.,Side characters- The situation is tense, you don't know who to trust, or what exactly they might do. But some.. Are just flat out insane.,Ellie- she's a great character, certainly better then Joel. You can relate to her, and always hope the best for her.,,Cons:,Joel- he's a boring character, never had a connection with him, although usually his arsenal is better then Ellie's .,Story- is too far predictable, me and my cousin laughed at times, because we knew what was going to happen. And the ending is sequel heavy. Not satisfying.,Enemies- some will magically see you or notice you even if you were in cover or moving quietly. Some wear helmets, many times I clearly shot the face, and the helmet just falls off. And there is far too many QTE, which makes it a button mashing fest.,Too linear- not enough room to scavenge or plan, it makes the game far too hard. Okay I understand Ellie can't swim, and this adds puzzles for Joel to help Ellie across the water. But why is the a 'convenient' plank for Ellie to step on, every where? It gets old really fast. And the DLC pack that comes with it, makes Ellie do certain actions for no apparent reason. Only to raise more controversy on the game.,,Special mention- this game was fun, but has bad pacing, and a list of other problems from keeping it great for me, but you do get your money's worth, for the length of about 20hrs doing everything. I don't exactly recommend this game, it isn't something special. And on the PS4 the graphics aren't as good as Infamous, it's still PS3 ish. Although this is the most mature Zombie game on the market.;normal;English;6
heathplusg;This game is a masterpiece, it has a very powerful storyline that shows an incredible bond between two characters, you will actually care for these two characters a lot compared to many other games where the main characters are easily forgettable.

Misfits95;This game came off as pretty average to me. People may have certain taste when it comes to what they love of this particular art form. Gameplay for me is crucial to what makes a video game. It's the foundation for many and it's what we would define a video game.,,The Last Of Us excels greatly in its presentation. Graphically it's the best of the best and second to none on console. I actually felt that what I saw in the game was actual real such as the buildings, infected, and people. The environments swell to the brim with technical and graphical brilliance. The characters come off as very interesting with Joel beaten by his 20 year experience in the new world order or his partner, Tess, hopelessly clinging to a hope that is far beyond her reach.,,The plot though unoriginal is performed very well by the games many interesting characters and has the highest of presentation value. The main issue I encountered while playing is that over the course of the main plot the protagonist comes across an epiphany. This is why the game is set in this period because it's the most important part of the protagonist life in this set time period. However, it fell flat when Joel doesn't come across any realization at all and stays the same as he was at the start of the game. Now some would say that Joel realized love, but that's only part of his character. Selfishness is the primary trait that governed Joel from the start of the game to its very end and it was very unsatisfying.,,The gameplay in this game could best be described as repetitive and bare bones. The games constant use of sneak through this environment and kill the same enemies over and over got very boring and it's mechanic of placing boards across gaps was rather laughable. The crafting system is very limiting of what you can make and felt like more of a minor mechanic rather than an essential part of the game. This game also suffers from replayability issues as it's story is rather limiting in interesting and original gameplay. I felt that I was watching a movie rather than playing an interactive piece of media most of the time.,,The multiplayer is this game's saving grace when it comes to gamplay offering very interesting modes that could carry the game on for several years.;normal;English;6

The story is about survival and gathering resources for your character to use in crafting aid items, weapon upgrades etc. The game is linear in nature however not that it detracts from its special cinematic sequences or it's beautiful yet eerie setting, plus there is subtle player choice to be had in naughty dog's latest outing say upgrading your weapons, crafting molotovs and first aid items like in rage the video game, very similar. The main aspects of the last of us is its realistic and wonderful graphics, stellar voice acting/animation and the feeling that grips you tight of how close you get to the two main characters in the game. There is certainly a emotional link to them throughout your adventure, and in time it will only grow. the combat system in the game is for the most part very smooth and fluid-like, you can sprint, jog, vault, take cover, sneak etc which all helps to take out your enemies in a stealthy manner or in a brutal, satisfying way. The game does from a story point of view pulls you right in and doesn't let go. It is a mix of survival horror/action adventure with both elements ever so subtle and seamless in their exchange. The aiming in the game is quite bothersome and has a lot of natural sway on the reticle, which can be reduced slightly by finding supplements and herbs to upgrade it with. The level design in the game is top notch, It is very diverse and with that allows you utter freedom to play the game how you want. The story line is very simple but expertly well done. And the ending in my opinion is truly satisfying and well scripted. The attention to detail with the graphics is outstanding, everything is so ironically full of life and colour, the water effects excel with everything i have ever seen. I do however have some minor gripes, but due to being so minor that they do not affect my final score, but there are infrequent graphical bugs, with items disappearing and entire parts of the game as well, but there are seldom seen and only last barely a second. And you can only alter the sensitivity of both analog sticks rather than individually change them. Also the cover mechanic is automated and sometimes you simply cannot stick to a certain wall and on occasion has given my position away. And i do also wish the survival skill system was more abundant in which you had more choice on given gameplay aspects like vaulting and running speed, melee moves, etc. The enemies are fantastic within the game and choose random paths, are quite perceptive and just generally fun to take out. The game has a multiplayer mode which has several modes and about 11 maps, the survival skills, crafting system, weapons, and gameplay mechanics are borrowed from the campaign, which is a good thing. It always for a slow paced and tense experience, certain mechanics are tweaked to allow for a more smoother and balanced play. And is generally a lot of fun, and the one of few multiplayers in which i have enjoyed and dedicated a lot of my time to. But with all the praise, the main reason i love this game is the colourful cast of characters and the emotionally driven storyline. Its a pure gem of a game and one that ill be playing for some years, a masterpiece.;normal;English;10
XposETiM3;Great game,great story,great multiplayer to extend the game to hes most,just dont get a 10 because of new xbox comers that think they r playing halo and ruin the multiplayer big time.;expanded;English;9

DirtyBird13;Naughty Dog puts a lot of time in their games and LOU is a perfect example. It is a great blend of horror, action, and great story telling. If that wasn't enough, it also comes with a competitive multiplayer. It is a great buy for new comers and veterans. Easily in my top 5 of best  video games.;expanded;English;10
Arthainius;My initial reaction was wow ok this game is a 10 .... then I played the multiplayer. I don't care if you don't think this is a multiplayer game.... mutliplayer was included as part of the game so you cant blindfold yourself to the fact that the game isn't perfect and that's what a 10 is. Its the same argument as Gta5.... Story mode is a 9.5 but multiplayer is a 6 compared to the other new console games.;normal;English;8
rjthakid;"Disregard the lone mixed review seeing as it comes from Gamer.no.  They have quite a few reviews that seem a bit off.  Examples: ""The Lord of the Rings: War in the North"" (Metascore:63, Gamer.no: 90), ""Fractured Soul"" (Metascore:70, Gamer.no:90), ""Warriors: Legends of Troy"" (Metascore: 44, Gamer.no:70).  There are quite a few more.  Their main issue with The Last of Us Remastered is the same frustratingly off-base claim that there isn't enough to warrant a SECOND purchase.  You don't review a remaster for the people who have already played the first one.  You review it on it's own merits, and on it's own merits The Last of Us Remastered cannot possibly receive a LOWER score than the original.  I'm sure there are a ton of PS4 owners who didn't buy the original because they didn't own a PS3.  There are likely many PS4 owners who came from owning the Xbox 360.  Or were only PC gamers.  Or sold their PS3 to pre-order the PS4.  Or any number of possibilities.  You review the game on it's merits.  Not because you, personally, played through the original and want to write a review for only those people who owned the original.  In short, The Last of Us Remastered is a remastered version of a masterpiece.  The original deserved (and received) 10s, and the remastered edition deserves no less.";normal;English;10
alexakosman;"A masterpiece,this is what ""the last of us"" is,I finished the PS3 version without owning the game and i still bought the remastered version included  with the console,maybe its even the first game that i am so fan about finishing it three time in a row...,First,the story is amazing and intensed as hell and the dialogues are very cool too,u even smile or laugh a couple of times,something that very few games make u do that,Second,the graphics are superb,technically i believe the best graphics of the generation while the whole animations,especially on the fighting scenes are DAMN!i could just be hitting the infected for hours and keep going!,The gameplay is just epic,maybe its not that new or different but it is simple,realistic and it does its porpuse,What can i say,is this the best game of the year?yes it is!the best game of ps3?i think that too...i could buy an ps3-ps4 just to play this game,considering how much money u can spend just to play on ultra graphics a game on PC...,Anyway,i think its the first time a give a 10/10 in a game...now that i have played 3 times and considering the multiplayer,i would give it a 8 or 9/10,but i think we have to judge the games for what is our first reaction with it so a solid 10/10 it is...!";normal;English;10
nnoom;Seriously the best game I have ever played. The story, gameplay, AI, everything about it was well done. ESPECIALLY the story. For the most part, I completely ignore the story in video games, and skip through cut scenes quite often, but I found myself playing The Last of Us to get to the next part of the story (and enjoying every second of it)! If you haven't already, buy this game.;expanded;English;10
Jacsam;This is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics are great. The pacing of the game is fantastic.  There is action followed by some calm to regroup and to allow for exploration.  Finding hidden objects are not just quest fetch they are needed to upgrade your character.  Then there is the story which has a lot of unexpected twists and turns.  The voice overs are great also. This is a must play game.;normal;English;10

stupidget;I've been playing video games since the early 80's (yep, I'm that old!) and I can honestly say that The Last of Us is easily one of the finest games I have every played.  I must admit that when I started playing I thought 'I don't see what all the fuss is about, it's just another FPS'.  But, I was oh so very very wrong. Once the game got going and the story kicked in I was completely hooked and I just needed to know what was going to happen next.  There are certain parts of the game that leave you feeling genuinely upset, others leave you terrified and others make you feel a rush of happiness that you will never have felt in a game before.  I know it sounds trite and cliche'd but that is how this game made me feel. The inclusion of the DLC Left Behind is brilliant as well and really add to the story.,,My only gripe would be the inclusion of the Photo Mode being applied to L3.  I ended up switching photo mode off because I was fed up with being in a close quarters fight and the action stopping in Photo Mode as I'd pressed L3 by mistake. Very annoying!,,I would sum it up as a game with the stealth of Metal Gear Solid, the FPS of Killzone, graphics of no other game I have ever played and a story so deep and powerful that I'm slightly disappointed that I've finished it and know what happens at the end.;normal;English;10
LiquidFrostbite;One of the best games I have ever played.,,The story is phenomenal and the combat is tight, balanced, and satisfying. One of the few games that tugs at your heart strings and forces you to feel for the two main characters as they make their way through their journey.,,The remastered edition makes this game easily the best looking on the PS4, followed closely by Infamous: Second Son.,,I love the stealth aspect of this game, planning out your strategy before approaching the enemy. The A.I. can be really stupid at times, especially the friendly A.I., but they work for the most part and I don't feel that it detracts from the game that much.,,I personally believe this is a game every gamer needs to experience atleast ONCE.,Easily a must own.;normal;English;10
mariox91;i do not owe a PS3 so it is my first time playing this game, in my opinion, the best and most touching storyline of any game I've ever played again, and now with even better graphics 1080p 60fps . this game was, and still is a crystal clear 10/10 a masterpiece!!!;expanded;English;10
tjsage;The best game I have played on my new PS4 so far. Wolfenstein comes next. I spend so much time looking forward to being in my own film that I get up early to sit in my chair the see new characters and what will happen. It restarts a bit different from where you saved it from. All of the characters are fun to get to know and be one with. I chose to use the great book to play the game with and I highly recommend that. Worth every dime spent on both. I will play again in a more difficult mode. It will change as it always does. I used to play the older version of Doom on a PC years ago and this is better than that.;normal;English;10
Pureray;I haven't really heard about this game since I didn't own a last gen console and that I didn't really have any friends that would play games. Once I saw that The Last of Us was going to be on the Ps4 from ads, I did a bit of research about the game without getting any spoilers. It sounded good so I went on ahead into buying it, which was a choice I did not regret after playing it.,,First I'll mention the cons then pros. The only con really has got to be the Ai during some encounters since they could get quite ridiculous at times, but which game was able to create perfect Ai, so I'll let this slide along with a small glitch I was able to find where you'll be able to kill yourself.,,The controller does a great job being apart of the game such has the hp light, the flashlight, and hearing audio recorders. The guns play out great whether you're shooting someone or getting shot by somebody which brings such a terrified feeling, well if you're on grounded difficulty (Hardest). The infected are scary as well when you're having to sneak by a bunch of clickers who can instantly kill you if they grab you. This game feels to real while playing.,,The multiplayer is fun, it does something different while progressing and highly relies on teamwork.,,Overall everything else I didn't mention is perfect! Great Job Naughty Dog, I'm looking forward to what else you'll bring.;normal;English;10
ThaKevMan;Somehow Naughty Dog made one of the best games ever produced even better. The story is still top-notch, with relatable characters you'll grow to love (or hate). The graphics are STUNNING, and the controls are much improved with the DualShock 4 controller. This is a must-have for any video game enthusiast, even if you own the original PS3 version. The game is truly worth a replay, and this is the best way to do it!;normal;English;10
kerrdar;This games is incredible and is much more realistic in its combat system. The story line and the change of pace between action and story are masterfully presented. This is a game well worth the price and is perhaps my favorite game that I have ever played. I am glad that I purchased a digital copy that I will never lose and that I can come back to time and time again.;expanded;English;10
Trinity;I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone that has never owned a PS3, and thus The Last of Us  on PS4 was my first experience with the game. The game quite simply blew me away. The characters and their interactions are believable and well-written, the gameplay is fluid and allows for multiple approaches to a situation and the graphics, art and music all have high production values and look/sound great. To me it wasn't so much a game as an experience that used cinematic storytelling. The criticism some level at this game, claiming it has 'no gameplay' and is basically one giant cutscene, is incredibly hyperbolic and makes me suspect they either haven't played the game or are just hating on it for no reason. The game doesn't have that many cutscenes at all and they are usually not more than 1 or 2 minutes. I was never annoyed or felt like the pacing of the game suffered from any cutscenes. It used them a lot more sparingly than some other games I've played on PS4, such a tomb raider and infamous second son.,,In conclusion: 10/10, must-get for PS4 if you haven't played it before.;normal;English;10
treborm81;I had xbox360 so i missed out when this came to ps3 cus i didnt have 1 ,, but i have to say im blown away like i was for the infamous last soon even tho that was 2 short but with the last of us ps4 1st day version u get the full game with added diffuclty as well as another side game aswell as online game very impressed ,, now if only the ps4 can get their finger out and get some games out that 9 million people had hoped for;normal;English;9
Murredly;With the exception of some screen tearing and some spots with terrible AI, this game is incredible and worth the buy for anyone who skipped the last gen of consoles.,,The story is amazing, more in line with a good movie than a game, and the actual interaction with the environment is stellar.,,The combat feels a bit like the Tomb Raider game, I have no clue what actually came out first, but having played both (and both being great games) I would definitely recommend anyone pick up this game. You won't regret it and I totally understand why people say this is a game that defined an era.;normal;English;9

AS97;The Last of us Remastered is NaughtyDogs latest game, and it's the best game they have every developed, and quite possible the greatest game of all time. This is one of very few games that has has effected me on an emotional level, making me care what happens to the characters and making me engage throughout the journey. This game will get you hooked from the moment you start up the game on your PS4 until the very end. This game manages to make Co-op with another AI fun, instead of making it frustrating and annoying. It also gives you the option on how you want to get through the area, whether its stealthily, using your inventory such as a Molotov Cocktails, Nail Bomb ,Smoke Bomb or go in guns blazing. It manages to break up the combat nicely and has different enemy types. The clickers are terrifying but creative creatures, using their sound to spot you instead of their eyes, making you cautious with your every move. Scavenging is also surprisingly fun, looking for certain items to build explosives, or finding ammo for your gun.,Its unfortunate to see games starting to become more online focused then on the campaign, the Last of us manages to have a fantastic storyline whilst having an enjoyable online experience. The game reminds us how important a campaign is, and how enjoyable and interesting it can be. The Last of Us is a must play for any gamer and a must have on PS4. The Last of Us has set a new bar on what games can potentially become and what we want to see in games like this.;normal;English;9

SeanGamerDays;Honestly, it was quite better than the PS3 version, but despite the Super graphics, i was expecting a new single-player content than the other ones inside disc.

PapaBurgundy206;"This game is okay. It was great and it wasn't bad. I had heard many great reviews about how this was the ""best game ever."" Maybe I went in expecting it to be and it turned out not to be. It still is a good game but I felt the plot was predictable, very ""Children of Men"" like. I liked the mechanics of the game. Controls were smooth and graphics were good. I guess the main thing I really didn't care for in the game was the fact that you are constantly having to find ammo/survivor gear. I understand it's a survival game but seriously, it's a little ridiculous how much time you actually have to spend finding stuff. Even when I upgraded my weapons and used my ammo only when i needed I still ran out.  The graphics were great and the music was good as well. Despite the problems I have with the game I can see why people enjoy it. I'm just a little picky when it comes to my games. Personally, I wish I would have rented it instead of buying.";normal;English;5

JakeBax1994;By far the best game I have ever played, from the start I felt a genuine emotional attachment to the Joel and Ellie which I didnt think was possible with video game characters, for example you will go to extreme measures to protect Ellie disregarding any self preservation. The combat also feels brutally violent, more so than any other game because the characters may as well be real people you've known your whole life;normal;English;10

Trunks252;"This was my first experience with this game. I went in with no prior knowledge other than what the back of the box already said, and that the ""zombies"" were fungal instead of a virus.,,The gameplay is very tight, responsive, and tactical. It requires thought and skill to advance through combat scenarios. That being said, there is nothing new or special about it. The puzzles are also fairly repetitive, almost always requiring you to find a floating object or a ladder. Overall, the gameplay is very good and well polished, but nothing special.,,The real lure of this game is the story and the characters. I grew very attached to Joel and Ellie, as should anyone who plays this. The ending was a little weak, but interesting regardless. At least it makes me want to play the sequel.,,I would recommend any gamer who has access to a PS3 or 4 to play this. Just keep your expectations in check. The game was over-hyped in my opinion, although easily one of the best of last generation.";normal;English;9
CalvinCrack;"of all the ""best games of all time"" that came out last year, I'd actually put Last of Us near the bottom.

XzRecolz;This game is not great, not bad, but just good. All the people that give this game a 10 don't own the game and just wasted the presentation. Because that was pretty awesome. The real game though is a serious letdown from what was promised. In the presentation, the A.I. was 100 times smarter than it is now. They said and showed that the A.I. would act different in different situations. For exemple, if an enemy was the last one in the building, they would run for their lives until they are save behind cover, throw something at you to weaken you and then attack you. In the game, they just run at you like some raging headless chicken. Also, when you're holding a gun, and the enemy has a melee weapon, they would sit behind a cornor waiting for you, so they can ambush you. What really happens is, again, they are just raging headless chickens coming at you with their weapon.,,After 5 hours I got SO tired of the 'Hey, let me boost you up' or 'Help me open this door' or 'Help me push this in front of the door' bs. This really slows the already slow gameplay. What also bothered me were the so called 'puzzels'... Just searching some piece of wood so Ellie can jump on it to get her to the other side. Nothing else, just that.,,Returning to the story, this is a story made for a movie, not a video game. I don't want to watch a total of 3 hours+ cutscenes, or just walking around with Ellie for 10 minutes, solve a 'puzzle' (getting her on a piece of wood), fight some dudes/infected, cutscene, puzzle, dudes/infected, repeat, repeat, repeat. Boring as a video game, good for a movie, with some changes.;normal;English;6
670Gamer;Great game! It does give you a sense that the main characters are in survival mode-infected, hunters looking for survivors, limited ammo and resources for crafting, and most especially a suspenseful storyline.

Haven't beaten it yet but as you can see or read, it's impressed me.;expanded;English;9

Darleh;I've been a PC gamer for the majority of my life and I really wanted to try this game out. I just never wanted to spend the money on a console (ps3). During the release of the PS4, it made sense to hop on board, due to the amount of exclusives that Sony has. This is by far one of the best single-player games I've ever played in my lifetime. This is up there with Half-Life (insert all the expansions), Half-Life 2, Bioshock, and many others.;normal;English;10
Gebhart25;"Honestly this is the best game I've ever played. The story may not be completely original but the way it's told and the way it's presented is what makes this game a 10/10. The gameplay is fun, the combat and stealth is challenging, and it's actually realistic. Most ""zombie"" games have you slashing through hordes of zombies but what Naughty Dog did with the Last of Us was genius. This game is truly a masterpiece. For a real, unbias review of this game look at Angry Joe's on Youtube.";normal;English;10
sunr1sE;Simply the best game I've ever played. I was worried about the fact that a remaster version would have been not enough to compete graphically, instead it's probably the best graphic experience until now, above Ryse. For the rest, great game, solid storyline, wonderful characters, wonderful places and environments, but we already knew that. I could actually fit in the character's feelings 'cuz this game was NUTS. In a competitive world where exclusives are the difference, games like TLOU really put weight on the balance board. Another piece of history for Sony.

Woofies;The Last of Us has its minor problems such as occasional unintelligent AI moments, which for the most part can easily be fixed by increasing the game's difficulty. Story is linear, but well written, and the level design is fantastic seeing that there are many different ways for you to tackle down areas with enemies, keeping the game from becoming stale and repetitive.Throughout my play-through there was never a moment where I didn't care for a character, all characters in the game where significant and unique. Not to mention the remastered edition comes with all the dlc and multiplayer maps previously released on the last gen console all for $50.,,NOTE: I have a PS3 but decided to wait for this game to come out for the PS4 seeing how many good reviews there are for it, it was obvious there were going to release it again for next gen and I was willing to wait, and I must say it is quite worth the wait.;normal;English;10
Jimmydm90;One of the greatest stories ever told through interactive media.  With each conversational aside and cutscene I felt myself falling in love with these two protagonists and many of the side characters they encountered. Their plight and they themselves felt real and because that I rooted for them.,,The visual beauty of this game can not be understated. I often caught myself mesmerized during cutscenes or in gameplay by the masterful environment design, character models and lighting. The power of the PS4 brings to life the texture of this gritty world. Every shattered tile, every fractured street, every scruff of beard and every blade of grass is a thing of beauty in and of itself, especially on closer inspection.,,The mechanics of TLOU are not revolutionary but they are very strong. I found it innovative and appropriate that when crafting or healing you're left totally exposed. It adds an extra level of realism and danger.  TLOU has a few bugs (texture popping, the AI gets stuck occasionally, etc) but nothing that detracts from what is honestly one of the greatest games I've ever played.,,I've only played a little of the multiplayer. It's about par for the course though it has some fairly long load times.,,The Last of Us is another bar setting game for Naughty Dog studios and for the video game industry at large. I can honestly say, that having just finished the single player,  I can't wait to go back and play it again.;normal;English;10
Zlatan;One of those games that you know you will be sad when it ends. A really solid 9 from me. The story/graphics/characters/voice acting all  weary well made. The only thing is a AI isn't perfect and weapons crafting/gathering a bit unrealistic and irritating. Naughty dog just makes damn good games... I am looking forward to uncharted 4.;expanded;English;9
raych;Never have i been so invested in a game and its characters before, its perfect! .The graphics, the story, the voice acting, the music and the actual gameplay all really work to immerse you into the story and by the end i was so involved i felt as if i was my character. it just shows how games can really create a full audience experience in a way that films, tv etc cant quite do. the remastered version has really made the already great graphics just stunning and the added photo mode is brilliant, not forgetting Left Behind the DLC that really could have created a full blown game on its own and the solid MP that makes you work as a team to survive. The game has rightly earned all its praise and is definitely one of the best games i've ever played.;normal;English;10
rrafemi;Everything is perfect.,History, characters, music, control..... simply awesome.,1080p and 60 frames looks a new game and looks as game creating for PS4. Just awesome.;expanded;English;10
aadms;GOTY, GOTY, GOTY.  I know it was already GOTY last year!  But it is that good of a game.  Best thing that I've played on PS4 so far.  Which I already played this on PS3, but it died a few months back, and since there are no games for PS4 out there, this was worth a return to play again, and besides I never played the DLC......  Anyway, I'm rambling.  This game is told very well, very intense, very emotional, it sucks you right in.  Sorry Xbox fans ( I have an Xbox360), but you'll need to get a PS4 or PS3 to play this, play this, play this.;normal;English;10
mdtaylor407;Bought a PS4 for this. Emotional, dramatic and most of all, makes you want to really sympathize with the characters. Not disappointed in getting a PS4 for this. 10/10;expanded;English;10
JD20;Enjoyed play this game even already played on ps3,graphics amazing and the dlc Left Behind is very good addiction,would like more dlc's like,but if you don't like playing a campaign more than one time,you should pass this game;expanded;English;10
JoshLuck1995;Same as the ps3 version but with the Left Behind DLC and imporved frame rate and textures, it remains a masterpiece of  a game, story is fantastic, graphics are brilliant, really sucks you in and makes you feel like your actually Joel. I give it a 9.8/10 - the only thing that bothers me is the AI is sometimes very dumb and it also annoys me when Ellie runs in front of them and they never seem to notice her.;normal;English;9
ketexan;If you played this game on the PS3 as I did, you will enjoy it all over again! The Remastered graphics are exactly that, Remastered and very nice. When compared to the PS3 version you can definitely tell the difference. The Last of Us must be in any conversation about the best video games of all times. The story is excellent, you will find yourself caring about the characters and want to know how the story ends.  The shooting is fantastic and it plays both all out combat and stealth elements brilliantly. I am not one of those type of gamers, that gets a game and plays it for hours straight until I beat a game. It usually takes me several weeks to finish a game as I don't have the luxury of playing for 12 hours at a time. But even though I had already played through the game once on the PS3, I found myself looking at the clock at work, so I could get home and play for a few hours. This game will do the same to you. It is a must play if you like video games. Great job Naughty Dog.;normal;English;10
steveo481;Wow, I'm only part of the way into this story and I feel hooked.  The acting is easily worthy of an award as I've never felt like I have cared about characters the way Naughty Dog created these characters.  It's also great to feel like my PS4 is being utilized to its capabilities.  The graphics are superb and the realism is certainly there.  If you are looking for a gripping story that will leave you feeling helpless at times and heartbroken at others, just to name a few emotions, pick up a copy of this.  Post-apocalypse survival has never been done so well!;normal;English;10
Commando_Brasil;I own a PS3 but have never played The Last of Us. Now on PS4 i played it and let me say to you, the game delivers a sensational experience. Its a must have for PS4. Great combat system, great story and a wonderful experience going through 60fps/1080p.;expanded;English;10
Poopypants123;What can I say about this game? Simply put, it's a masterpiece and a must play for anybody who calls them self a gamer. Quite possibly the best game ever made. Incredible;expanded;English;10
reptilexcq;The Last Of Us Remastered for PS4 is what I expected from Naughty Dog after reading so many great things about the game.  I have never played it even though i owned a PS3.  The graphics for this game is amazing.  It's the best looking graphics I ever seen in a video game...although I notice some areas are better than others.  Even some cut-scenes are better than others.  The sound is also amazing.  It's like a movie.  In fact, the whole game play feel like a movie.  I didn't hurt that it's got a great story as well.  Even though the graphics is great, I can wait what's in store for the sequel.  I am sure the graphics will be EVEN better.  The game does has some flaw though such as awkward movement of the character.  Sometimes they don't seem to move or run smoothly.  The graphics in some areas are amazing and in others just so-so.  The download content Left Behind has better overall graphics and overall smooth.  The game play is what set this game apart with the melee killing of the zombies so good that you want to keep punching.  The gores and blood is stunningly details.  This game deserved a 9.5 just because I feel that some areas, the character move awkward and the graphics were not up to par.  I am sure the sequel will be 2x better.  Can't wait.;normal;English;9
DSouls_guy;I never had the chance to play *the last of us on ps3*so I decided that I would play it on ps4 instead,and all I can really say is that if you are a ps3 or ps4 owner do yourself a favor and honor of playing this masterpiece of a game.the store is heart pounding and the graphics are looking sharp.I never thought I would feel for any characters since ff7 until now.I really cared about what happened to everyone in the last of us and got worried when things went bad for them,great feeling to have again for a game.now the bad news is that like many games there are some technical issues here and there like pop up in game  or in my case i was running through an ally while being chased and all of a sudden the screen went black for a few seconds and when the game came back on screen i was where i first started off at in the lvl weird!!!. but like I said before no game will ever be glitch/bug free on release.;normal;English;9
Cale-wss;amazing game i have removed 2 points form the score just because they added loads of paid only items i was under the impression all dlc was included (had enough of been squeezed for every penny);expanded;English;8
1234;i didnt have the chance to play this last gen due to not owning a ps3 so now i have a ps4 i thought id give it a go . the obvious things about the game are that the visuals are spectacular and the story is thrilling , the core game mechanics and components are great. but there are some genuine faults with this game. the biggest one is the multiplayer its just awful , i will never understand why a wooden plank is more powerful than a bullet to the face(or 3 bullets for that matter) as for the campaign i feel the movement can be a bit too sluggish and slow even when trying to get away from enemies its clumsy. also the AI and enemies are temperamental one minute they can see you right in front of them the next they can see and hear you 50 plus feet away in a blizzard when you are behind them, also for some reason it can take up to 3 bullets to the face for people to die (makes no sense) the overall gun play is great but i can never understand why in games these days gun damage balance is **** . im enjoying it though;normal;English;8

thekillergreece;This one is definitely a masterpiece.,,If you have played the PS3 version and switch to PS4 version, you will notice a big different to gameplay and graphics. How so? PS4 version has improved and better graphics such as better water reflects, building design, model design, facial design and so on. Gameplay has been improved as well having 1080p and 60fps which means you will have smoother gameplay on shootout and so on.,,The story is nice as well, especially the relationship between the main characters and how balanced is the encounter between Infected and Bandits.,,If you like survival horror games with balanced encounter of infected and bandits, buy this game.,,I rate it 10/10.;normal;English;10
GekkoSoldier1;Overall the game is good and fun, Thriller , Horror , Adventure, Shooter using cunning and wits this game keeps you interested to the end and after a good multiplayer game online with people you know makes this even greater ^^D;expanded;English;10
Avodeskorm;Story- Overrated,Gameplay- Underrated,,Not the most intriguing story ever, not even the most intriguing story on the PS4. However the gameplay is what made this game for me. Think of mass effect (If the dialogue was free-flowing and not 'Let us stand around waiting for you to think of an answer.'), Think of Half Life 2 (and how quiet-time established how much it greatly improves the experience), Think of the Metro Series (Environmental Storytelling). The main complaint I hear about the gameplay is that the AI is glitchy/terrible. There's a cure people. Just raise the difficulty from Easy or Normal to a higher one (you big baby playing it on easy, shame on you),,Factions MP is fun as long as you just don't use the strategy everyone else is using.,,If you want a deep, philosophical, strange, satirical commentary-like storyline you probably should look somewhere else then here. It is character driven, like most great storylines however the story just wasn't what I find interesting. For the average movie-goer this will be a blast. A dark story yet with some happiness hidden inside.,,OH WAIT DID I FORGET THAT IT IS A GRAPHICS UPDATE?! SILLY ME. Don't buy it if you want to spend 50 quid on it. You are not missing out on alot if you are just going to play the game over again. 60fps and some extra clothes are not enough to justify another purchase. (Unless you loved the Factions mode to death and want to continue to play it.);normal;English;10
mmrventricle;While it is certainly upsetting when companies re-sell games for easy cash, TLOU sure is a classic that deserves to be played and replayed, and the graphics sure are gorgeous.,A 95 out of 100 is a bit of a hype, but The Last of Us Remastered earned it.;expanded;English;9
Funkymonk;Firstly, for the benefit of those of those who havn't heard of this game (!!!) - The Last of Us is a story driven action game with elements of stealth, horror and third person shooting. It was originally released on the PS3 to widespread critical and commercial acclaim with many people considering it one of, if not the best game of the last generation.,Basically, the game is still brilliant and remains the measuring stick for it's genre of game. If you havn't played it before and you've got a PS4 then it's a no brainer, you simply MUST play it. The big question is whether you should buy it if you already own it on PS3. What you're getting apart from the obvious improved graphics is all the DLC and a making of documentary. Really this is down to the individual whether you think these extras make it worth buying again. But the game itself? Peerless!;normal;English;9
mrfloyd;This is the best Ps4 game till now BY FAR (including destiny´s beta). And one of the best videogames ever made. There´s always things to improve in videogames that´s why I give it a 9.5, but they made a HUGE advancement for the hole industry, Naughty Dog raised the bar in so many ways!! thank you naughty dog, thank you sony keep up the good work, keep up making this works of art and I will keep on buying them.;normal;English;10
JackValentine;Like it or not, The Last of Us is an undeniable masterpiece, despite some minor shortcomings in it's combat.,Its immersive story, incredible characters and heart wrenching writing made for one of, if not THE best PS3 game of all time... And now, it's undoubtably the PlayStation 4's best title, and will probably remain that for a long while.;expanded;English;10
benthedangerboy;Amazing game. The Last of Us finally justifies buying the PS4. Didn't play it on PS3 and it looks awesome. The story is so comparable to The Road / The Walking Dead. Amazing mechanics. Overall a genius of a game!;expanded;English;10
unluckydice;Was more than glad to pick this one up again especially now on next gen, with now 1080p 60fps single and multiplayer plus a new difficulty mode called grounded. For anybody who never had the chance to play The Last Of Us on PS3 I recommend getting it, I consider this game to be the consoles best game or at least a great contender for the best game of its generation. Not only is the single player top notch the multiplayer is indept and addictive too.;normal;English;10
shadi2000000000;While it may not seem like much, 1080p resolution and 60 fps are very welcome improvements for a nearly perfect game. Naughty Dog managed to do a flawless technical adaptation for the PlayStation 4. We would have loved a bit more extra content, but we can't complain, as the game already is one of the best ever created for a Sony platform.;expanded;English;10
v_iHuGi;This Game is one of the finest games i played LAST GEN and now it gets even better, with better graphics, better gameplay due to superior controller and ALSO much better FPS, its locked at 60 Frames and it feels really good.,,You must buy this game and a Ps4 to play it, it just incredible.;expanded;English;10
Mattyice;Having not played The Last of Us on PS3, I had uber high expectations about this game, now that it was on PS4. The game has not disappointed me. The story is great, the graphics are pretty good, the multiplayer is very fun and quite original, and the DLCs are good as well. It was a worthy purchase and this game is fantastic and should be played by anyone with a PS4.;expanded;English;9
pithing_needle;You know how I can tell a game is great? Because I didn't like it at all and still admit it that it's a great title. I tried it because I succumbed to the hype. I don't like linear, interactive movie style games. That's why I never bothered with Uncharted. But I don't have to like a game to acknowledge how good it is. Last of Us is more than a game...it's an achievement.;expanded;English;9
k3Ck;"First off, I am a 30 year old gamer with all consoles (Wii U, PS4, XB1), handhelds (Vita and 3DS), and a high end PC (Dual GTX 780 SLI).  I've been gaming since the days of Atari and have owned nearly every major console since and I have a collection of roughly 800 games from 80s to present day.  The Last of Us is by far one of the best games I have ever played in my life.  It is an absolute masterpiece that will blow away even the highest of expectations.  Everything about the game is stellar - story, graphics, sound, acting, and gameplay.  If you consider yourself a ""gamer"" then you must play this, it simply can not be missed.  The Last of Us will become a true classic and will be remember and talked about until the end of time.  Anyone who says this game is ""overrated"" is a troll that hasn't played it and most likely watched 5 minutes of youtube gameplay.  Bottom line is this is one of the best single player experiences ever and won't be topped for a long long time to come.";normal;English;10
Slappy508;This is my first time playing the game, having missed out on the ps3 version.,All I can say is wow. At all times the immersive storyline and gameplay keeps you wanting more, at no point do you want to put that remote down. Rarely have I played a game that is so engaging with the user. Your emotions are taken on a roller coaster from finally managing to escape an area to getting to the next dark turn and hearing clickers somewhere in the distance that puts your heart in your mouth. It is incredibly intense. At 60 frames the combat  mechanics is incredibly smooth and it absolutely has to be, you can't afford to waste a bullet. Now the big debate, do you buy this for the ps4? As a new player, absolutely no debate. It's a must have. If you own it on ps3? I could see why players would want to return to this game, if not now chances are a few month or years down the line. I gave this game  a 10 because it's everything a game should be;normal;English;10
MikefromAngus;The 1080p Makes a HUGE difference! The graphics are amazing! The action is no 60 pfs which makes it super smooth as well! Its like playing the game all over again!;expanded;English;10
Raviel1827;"While the original game deserves more of an 8/10 (To clarify this score, it's a great game but not without flaws, a plot that's very predictable and very much like ""Children of Men"", pretty dumb A.I. and stupid forced moments took away from my experience with the game, that might not concern you though).,The remastered version doesn't improve on the core experience enough to grant a second purchase. However when it includes all the DLC it proves itself to be more of a Game of The Year edition. Without the DLC I would've easily given it 5/10.,Conclusion: Definitively worth a buy if you haven't already gotten it.";normal;English;7

Deadspacelover1;Since I am a huge fan of The Last of Us, it was a treat experiencing, in my opinion, the best and most touching storyline of any game I've ever played again, and now with even better graphics. this game was, and still is a crystal clear 10/10.;expanded;English;10
Kraos_1;My review does not take into account the multiplayer and photo mode: 1)the multiplayer is amazing, but single player is where this game is at its best and where the focus should be 2)the multiplayer, when I played it on July 29th, was extremely glitchy and the hit detection was wonky...the opponent often times looked like The Flash running in front of you at super speeds 3)I hate photo mode as when I'm moving around I accidentally bring it up as it's tied to L3...oh well, this game didn't need it.,,With that said, I played the opening sequence of the game (up to the point prior to seeing what you are smuggling out of the quarantine zone) and I fell in love with this game all over again. I played this game on the PS3 last year and am glad the feel was kept in the remastering of this game. The higher resolution and with it running at 60fps, you can really tell a difference in the smoothness of the gameplay and the textures really pop...even compared to the very well done PS3 version.,,I highly recommend this game for anyone who has a PS4. It doesn't matter if you played this on the PS3 or not....get....this....game. It is the best movie I have ever played.;normal;English;10
Eikast;I loved this game on the PS3 and I am loving it on the PS4. This game has one of the best stories of all time. I really feel like this is a movie more than a game (story is that great) but plays amazing (not like those failed games that focus on only the story and neglect the mechanics/gameplay).,,Pro:,-Improved graphics,-60 FPS or loked 30 FPS with improved shadows,-Uses the DS4 controller (best controller ever),-Includes all of the DLC (not the extra stuff for multiplayer like cosmetics),-Photomode (this mode will consume a good portion of your time. So much fun),-I never played multiplayer mode on the PS3 but wow, the MP on this game is so much fun and amazing.,,Cons:,-I personally haven't experienced any but one bug in which Joel disappeared for a few seconds while playing but that was just it. I've heard of people experiencing some other minor bugs but I'm sure that all of these will be patched soon.;normal;English;10
Stafmeister;I enjoy games with a strong story the most and this is like playing a movie. The difference between the PS3 and PS4 version is like playing on VHS and now on Blu Ray.

AdrianChan;The original The Last of Us is a masterpiece, Gameplay, story, music, voice acting etc. is nearly perfect. I give the PS3 version a 10/10, All the DLCs are put together which is fantastic. However, considering the game has just released last year and it already looked very stunning and beautiful, even though this one looks even better with the improvement of graphics and gameplay, it is not significant enough. That doesn't really impress me. I also understand Sony want to give a chance to the Xbox 360 players who switch to PlayStation to play this masterpiece . I appreciate it but barely any other content is added besides that Infamous SS camera. Some glitches and bugs still exist in the remastered version, and the AI don't really have much improvement. I was sort of disappointed. Nevertheless, The Last of Us is still one of the best game I have ever played and I enjoy playing it again, but if you own the original PS3 game already, it is rather pointless to buy it again for PS4, but if you have never played it before, you should get this, cuz it is awesome.;normal;English;8
JohnConnor333;After spending more time on ps4 version, the multiplayer is severely BROKEN. Chat will cut in and out, when you party up with friends, they will end up on opposite teams, finding a match appears broken - as it can take up to 30 minutes to find a game, and the facebook feature is not working. Unacceptable. Of course, they will release 5gb patches in the coming weeks to fix this. I'm burned out with this generation of gaming. They send the game unfinished while you wait or patches. Why no one else is talking about this is beyond me, but if you look it up it is taking place.,,PS3 is the better experience;normal;English;0
TheSmutPeddler;1080p.60 frames per second. One of the best looking games on PS4,or any console for that matter.If you've never played this game before, PLAY IT. This game won't wow you at first, but the story takes you in and the gameplay gets awesome when you use what you have(molotov,explosives,shotguns,etc). Crafting a healthpack while a clicker is looking for you adds alot of tension in the game. Every enemy in the game feels like a threat and you can't run and gun very easily. You have to take them down one by one and every bullet counts. You craft a shiv (knife) to take down a clicker and you have to find the materials for that. Joel and Ellie are very well written characters. They are very raw and real characters. They aren't written to get you to like them, they are written for how the writers feel they truly should be, given the circumstances.,The DLC Left Behind is very good. DO NOT PLAY IT BEFORE YOU BEAT THE GAME.,If you wan't a dark,raw, gore filled game with an amazing story that won't shy away with messing with your emotions, then this game is for you.;normal;English;10
CanadianSk8er;This is probably in my top five games of all time. The original was great looking but this one is improved with the frame rate increase, draw distance, textures and character models. If you've played it already on PS3 it may not be worth it, but if you haven't, or haven't played the Single Player DLC I'd strongly recommend it. As a return customer, I purchased it to experience the story again in the hardest difficulty, but also purchased it for the multiplayer. It is a ton of fun, and not  a ton of my friends had it or still play it on PS3. Getting a crew together and working together in the multi is an amazing time. To fans of the original wanting to go through it again and wanting a renewed online community this is great. Photo mode is also a super cool add on that I will be utilizing for sure;normal;English;10
SoftwareLibre;I played this game on PS3 and now bought it again for the PS4, the original was already a masterpiece, this version comes with all multiplayer and single player DLC. As in the PS3 version, the story is emotional, ranging from funny to depressing mood, fighting is very flexible and invites for experimenting with different approaches. While the visual upgrade is not that huge, since it was already looking fantastic, the higher frame rate changes the experience for the better, especially during fighting. The reason I think it is worth getting this game again is because it has high replayability beyond the story itself (e.g. multiplayer) and if you have a PS4, you want this title in your game library. If you never played it before, it's a must-have anyways.;normal;English;10

I'm not entirely happy with the narrative approach, which seems to be The Walking Dead soap-opera style, but at least voice acting is great.,PS. I've seen an episode of WD once. Two women were washing clothes in a river. Then one solitary zombie was killed in a non-spectacular way, and at episode's end everyone gathered in a room and cried together.;normal;English;9
Kaniya;The Way its meant to be play ...,The last of us Remastered packs a lengthy and memorable single player plus a wonderful and unforgettable DLC and a fantastic multilayer mode along with all the DLCs published until today.,The HD remastered is not mind-blowing if you have already played on PS3 but you will be able to notice how sharp and clear all the game is in comparison to PS3 version, Textures are in a higher quality form and draw distances are much more clear, with that being said, even though technical quality of TLOU is no comparable to a next gen game but surprisingly the game is that much well crafted that is really holding up to this very day very well and it is still awesome to gaze upon the beauty of this game.,the biggest advantage in the Remastered edition is that the game runs on 60fps, it makes the combat really fluent and much more believable than it was on PS3, overall experience is just awesome in 60fps but in case you still like that cinematic looking and feel of 30fps ND has put the option to lock the FPS to 30 under display options, as well make sure you update the game because the shadow maps will improve when you game is switched to 30fps but with that being said still the 60fps is more preferable.,I can not say much about the gameplay, one word just fantastic, every part of the game is crafted very well as if each parts are made to test are ability of surviving, the story, character developments are wonderfully written throughout the game and after a while you will start to feel a bound between yourself and the characters in the game ....,Finally the multiplayer is awesome as well, i wont spoil it for you if you havent been able to play it on  ps3 but i can say this game worth of 49$ even if you wanna go only for multiplayer experience ( like me ).,Finally the last of us is packed with a 20~25 hours of single player content and countless hours of multiplayer content only for 49 dollar, its one the best (and perhaps) the best game of the last gen consoles ....,I recommend this if you havent played TLOU, and if you are a fan of game otherwise there isnt much reason to pick up this game ....;normal;English;10
chrisjones914;What was already an amazing game is made even more amazing with the addition of enhanced graphic and the inclusion of all of its DLC! Also very impressive was the inclusion of new pathways through levels and some new camera angles! For more what makes The Last of Us my personal favorite game of all time please see my Playstation 3 review!;expanded;English;10
Joeyi05;It's the same masterpiece I enjoyed on PS3 except better looking. The added DLC is also a big bonus, but not necessary. This game is a perfect 10 anyway you slice it, from story to gameplay, etc. Anyone who rated this game lower than a 10 is just trying to be different or get attention that they aren't getting in their personal life.;expanded;English;10
kindaichi83;i do not owe a PS3 so it is my first time playing this game and it is one of the best game I have ever played.,,such intense story and gameplay! the graphics and voice overs are very professional too! highly recommended for all!;expanded;English;10
MaxLexandre;"The game is worth the highest score possible, it should not be downrated based on the ""Console Exclusive Meh"" kind of talk. It was one of the most interesting games i ever played, i like the mix of story with gameplay.";expanded;English;10
Dadrik;Why does this game is getting such bad reviews by some ?,Salty much ?,,Anyways, if you've already played the game on your PS3, you might not be interested by this Remastered Edition, even though the visual upgrade is important.,But if you never owned a PS3 or never played this game, this is a must have.,,First of all, it's absolutely gorgeous. The art direction is phenomenal, the views are stunning, the characters look great... This is indeed a beautiful looking game.,Furthermore, its performance is a real plus. The PS3 version suffers from framerate dips down to the 20s. The lowest I've experienced on this game must've been around 45-50 fps, during really intense moments (bloaters, for example. Loads of particle effects involved.).,But for the most part, about 98% of the time, it runs at a solid 60fps.,,The gameplay is great, the fist fights are really intense, and the shooting, usually pretty rare, and always short, is really well done.,,But if there is a main reason to play this game, it's its story. It's absolutely phenomenal. The characters are formidable (just try to hate them... oh wait, you can't), the pacing is great and fits the game's atmosphere perfectly, there are some really intense moments... This is a truely great game. One that will be remembered for all the good reasons.,,Of course some people hate on it. But well, it seems to be a trend with PS exclusives...,,Anyways, a serious 10/10. A must have.,And as I said, if you already played it, except is you're a hardcore fan are are dying to play it again, don't buy it. The game hasn't changed.,But if you haven't, just freaking go for it. The hell are you waiting for ?,,Also, there is a photo mode. It's a gimmick, but it's a nice plus, and allows us to make great screenshots.,,10/10, nuff said. Best game in a while.;normal;English;10
CouchLicker;"There is only a few games I missed Last Generation and The Last of Us was the one I wanted to play the most. I am a huge fan of the Uncharted games and Naughty Dog's great cinematic experiences and character driven focus that they have presented in the last 7 Years.,,The upgrades to 1080p and 60 FPS should be reason enough to call this remastered, but Naughty Dog has included all of its previous DLC and updates which gives you a more than the Value of the game and should give reason to the Non-DLC gamers out there to have a better (and maybe even a new) experience with a more complete game.,,I am sure for those who have already put more than 30 Hours into the PS3 version will have a hard time recommitting to ""Game of the Year"" edition (so to speak), but it shouldn't cause the game to receive lower ratings.,,This game is simply put as such, if you LOVED the game on the PS3, then owning a more complete version with better overall performance (at a $25 trade-in rate at Gamestop) is a No-brainer. If you have NOT played this game, it is a highly cinematic, stealth, action, horror game that will surely give any gamer an amazing experience and worth every penny. If  you played the PS3 version and felt like you already experienced everything there is to offer, than there is not much purpose in re-buying it.";normal;English;10
heckler;One of the best games I have ever played in my 17 years of playing video games. It isn't perfect, but it is as close to perfection as you could reasonable hope for. What is so special about this game is that while it does the storytelling part of it (story, characters, pacing, ambiance, music) so incredibly well, it doesn't do it to the detriment of its game play. What I actually played perfectly complimented the story they were trying to tell, but when you took those same mechanics, and put them into a competitive multiplayer in the form of Factions, you got one of the most unique (as unique as a TPS multiplayer can be) multiplayers of the last generation. Kudos to Naughty Dog, you guys have achieved something special here. It's too bad some people (looking at the low-effort negatives) can't grant you that much.,,As for the remastered part of this: it is the same video game, but it looks tons better, and it sweetens it by including in game commentary, a photo mode, and all DLC. All of that for a lower than normal MSRP. Definitely worth the price to newcomers, but also people who enjoyed it in the past, so that you can see the world Naughty Dog has painted for you that much more clearer.;normal;English;10
ZombieVito;One of the best games ever and the most critically awarded one with prettier graphics, DLC and better frame rate? YES please.,,Anyone who likes great storytelling games should not pass this one up.;expanded;English;10
awohlleb;When you stand at the top of the heap with this quality, people are looking to take aim.  Is it perfect?  Nothing in life is, but it's the closest product to being perfect most will experience.  Is it for everyone?  Not necessarily, but  you'd be avoiding a game that defended a generation and one that deserves a look.  It is intense, it is funny, it is all the things any great piece of entertainment should be like.  People will ultimately form new greatest of lists in the future and it's most certain that this will be on all of those lists.;normal;English;10

Jovi_seph;I picked up The Last of Us Remastered about 2 weeks prior to it's release, and have already played through it once, and have already delved into Grounded mode for the second run though, which is insanely hard. Naughty Dog has outdone it again. The game is a gem, it's a shame that any moron can create an account and write a negative review of the game. Clearly all the negative comments and rating are by people who have never played the game. And for the public, the game just released, how do you give it a 1 or a 0 when you clearly haven't played through the game and all it's additional content? Unlike most people I had two weeks to sit down and enjoy the game, and I just broke the ice. I haven't even touched multiplayer. With all of the additional content that Naughty Dog has included in this game, it's more than worth $50. People should actually play the game before docking the score because they are ignorant and clearly have something against great storytelling and gameplay. On that note, whoever has not picked up a copy, it's worth your while, and it's only $50.;normal;English;10
JacksReviews;Anything less than a perfect score would be ludicrous. The Last Of Us: Remastered revitalises the original game, allowing it to reach new heights of superiority [...] The Last Of Us is less a video game, and more a spiritual experience. 5*;expanded;English;10
DanteDX2011;"This is the best videogame i ever play in a long time, the last generation was so bad not because the games was bad, is because the companies becomes greedy as hell for the fault of creation of microsoft, the  DLC's.One prove of that is capcom. Releasing incomplete games whit a lot  of ""DCL's"" that are already on the disc.

lukszu;so glad that this came out as remaster edition for next gen as I have jumped from X360 to PS4, I was so hyped about this title and now have a chance to play this masterpiece...everything in this game is amazing, starting with story line, through gameplay and visuals...one of the best games Ive played, a must play for anyone who did not play the ps3 version and think still a nice come back for those who enjoyed it last year.;normal;English;10
Phaedrus73;Truly Amazing game.  Everything that I loved in the PS3 version of this game is even better now.  Amazing Single Player, fantastic Multiplayer, and all the DLC included in the price.

Tastycakes;"The Last of Us is impeccably crafted and overall a well done game. It's called anything from a masterpiece to the greatest game people have played, but this is the remaster, so I'm going to focus on how worth it it is to pick up for a first, as well as a second play through.,,If you have never played this game before, buy it. This game will give you more hours and higher quality gameplay than almost any other for the cost. The replay value, multiplayer, free DLC and difficulty are enough to warrant the purchase, but if you already owned it on PS3...,,Buy it again. In order to see why this game is worth picking up a second time, let's look at what ""Remastered"" actually means. 49 dollars gets you:,,- 30 dollars worth of DLC bundled in free.,- Improved visuals, shadows, framerate (60 fps), textures, etc.,- Dualshock 4 integration. Audio logs can now be played via the controller instead of needing to stay in the menu, the light bar signals how low your health is, etc.,- FULL LENGTH making of documentary included.,- Directors commentary optional during cut scenes, includes other voice actors as well.,- Photo mode.,- Hardest difficulty mode that used to be DLC now included as well as being accessible for first play throughs.,- Advanced audio options finally.,-Multiplayer boost for Ps3 owners.,,So for 49 dollars, you get 30 dollars worth of DLC, a full length documentary, a multiplayer boost, a new difficulty available instantly... and then after that you add on the remastered visuals and audio.,,This game features new game plus, high difficulties, engaging and unique multiplayer, engaging and free DLC and now it comes packed with interested special features. All for less money than other games on the system. It's the best bang for your buck for the PS4, even for returning players. This isn't just a remaster, it's how all remasters should be done.";normal;English;10

hotterthansoup;Great game. Moving over to 60 fps was the right move. The graphics really pop off the screen and the story is top notch. I'm seeing a lot of little babies starting to leave bad reviews to tank the score. Doesn't matter though. The game is a masterpiece.;expanded;English;10
Kenmei;I don't feel the need to rehash everything that has already been said about this game. It was easily in the top 3, probably the best game, for the last gen consoles and it is easily one of the best experiences I've ever had in gaming. But what about the remastered version. Is it worth buying again for those who've already done everything there is to do on the PS3 version? I'd say yes with a few caveats.,The biggest thing you'll notice first is the graphics. There is a very clear upgrade in the visuals, even if it doesn't exactly stand up to a game like inFamous. It comes close but you can tell this was a game that was designed for the last gen consoles. I've heard that it looks like a game that's on Ultra high settings on the PC and I think that's a very good description of it. Plus they've tweaked the controls a bit to help with some of the clunkyness of the original game. I really like the big button in the middle of the controller that opens your inventory screen and it's easier to use than the select button on the old game.,There are a few things that I don't like about this version though and it starts with the price. 50 bucks for this game is way too high. 40 seems reasonable but 50 is really high for a game that's been out for awhile and has been down to 20 bucks in the last week on the old consoles. Plus there have been a number of glitches that occurred in my game. Lots of stiff movements, running through walls, cutscenes not properly loading. It's only happened in the first hour of my playthrough so far but there's been enough of it to cause me an issue. Fortunately nothing has happened during a fight yet so things are not as bad.,The fact of the matter is though that this game is still easily one of the best gaming experiences ever to be released and you're doing yourself an injustice not playing it at least once. For people like myself who have already beaten the main game and DLC on the PS3, there is still alot of playability here mostly for the fact that there's nothing else to really get for the system for awhile. If you're looking for something you know will be excellent and to relive one of the best games in recent memory, then you have to pick this game up. Even with the fairly steep price tag, it's still worth it.;normal;English;10

Fancypenguin;"What can be said about The Last Of Us that can't be said about the The Last Of Us in 60FPS/1080p? Marvel as a few tiny details that you wouldn't notice at all unless somebody told you it was upgraded.  Relive the Masterpiece that won more Game Of The Year Awards than Super Mario Galaxy and Ocarina Of Time combined by having none of that silly gameplay or imagination and more story about dirty depressed people getting their lives F***ed up.  Speaking of Ocarina of Time, if you thought the Water temple from Ocarina Of Time was a mindf**k, prepare for the mind bending puzzles in The Last Of Us, such as moving that same ladder to the same spot in the same way over and over again.  Good game design? Who needs it when you can get perfect 10s by having a story that is the video game equivalent of Oscarbait?  Gaze in absolute awe as you watch the same stealth takedown  a million times, because with the oil tanker full of money that Sony gave Naughty Dog to make this game, they couldn't spring for more than one stealth kill animation.  They say that games are getting dumbed down for the casual gamers nowadays, but I strongly disagree.  At one point in this game, I only had like 30 bullets.  If that's not what you call hardcore survival gaming, then I don't know what is.  People also say that its just ""Another zombie game"" which is ridiculous because they're not zombies.  Its clearly explained that they are a fungal spore, and the fact that they all act exactly like zombies is not important.  Why have interesting level design when you can shepherd the player along linear corridors because you wouldn't want them to get lost on their way to the next cut scene, and have all the fights take place in arenas made of conveniently placed boxes and shipping containers like the new Metal Gear Solid game if Hideo Kojima was on Ambien for the entire development process.  Clunky shooting gameplay? In a zombie game? Who cares, it adds tension, I mean Resident Evil does it, right? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying The Last Of Us is comparable to Resident Evil, The Last Of US has nowhere near achieved the legacy of Resident Evil, mostly because it hasn't spawned sequel after quality degrading sequel... Yet anyway... Your companion AI often breaks immersion by running around mindlessly without alerting the enemies, but again who cares because story.  To once more bring up Resident Evil, I wish they had made Ellie able to be seen, but you have the option to shove the little brat in a trash bin until the adult stuff is taken care of.  Again, people like to complain that Cinematic games like The Last Of Us are for casuals and are a cancer to the gaming industry, but I like to say they are made for people who want different experiences from games, like somebody who watches movies for the set design.  Cinematic experiences are amazing in games,   why use the power in that Next Gen console to make games with huge open worlds or give the game more dynamic AI when you can use it to replicate movies?  Furthermore, why let a game's gameplay influence your experience with and feelings toward it,?  I definitely won't  miss moments like in Twilight Princess when I first stood on the cliff overlooking Lake Hylia, the guitar track playing a solemn melody, as I stared at a dark but beautiful world, ravaged by an ongoing struggle for the Triforce, I, the lone hero sent to save it.  Screw that, I'd much rather the game yell ""THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD BE FEELING AND WHAT YOU SHOULD BE EXPERIENCING"" at me with the subtlety of Nic Cage in a French art film.  Its not like video games are the one artistic medium that allow you to interact and effect the outcome of the actions being portrayed on screen (Well besides maybe a choose your own adventure novel). One probably wonders why every game doesn't take as much control as possible out of the players hand so they can watch all the interesting stuff happen in a cutscene they can't interact with in anyway.  Overall, The Last Of Us is a great story, with a so-so game buried deep within it.  That equates to a Great game overall that is better than the sum of its parts and not a masterpiece like everybody says it is. But my opinion is moot anyway, seeing as everybody else is just going to give it a 10 so why did I even bother?";normal;English;8
